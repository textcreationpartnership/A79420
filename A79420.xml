            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THOU art here preſented with a little piece, of a Great Man; Great indeed, if great Piety, great Parts, great Learning, and great Wiſdom, may be admitted to claim that Title: And we verily believe that none well acquainted with him, will deny him his right; however malevolent Perſons may grudge him the honour. It hath been expected, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired by many, that ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Life might be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb facs="tcp:136156:3"/>to the world; But we are not willing to offer violence to his aſhes, by making him <hi>ſo</hi> publick now he is Dead, who ſo much affected privacy while he lived. Thou art therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to reſt ſatisfied with this brief account of him, That being very young he went to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where in <hi>Immanuel Colledge</hi> he was brought up under the Tuition of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> What Gracious workings and Evidences of the New-Birth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in him while there, hath already been ſpoken of by<note n="*" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> in his Sermon on oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of Mr. <hi>Charnocks</hi> death.</note> one, who was at that time his <hi>Fellow Collegiate</hi> and Intimate. Some time he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſpent in a private Family,
<pb facs="tcp:136156:3"/>and a little more in the exerciſe of his Miniſtry in <hi>Southwark;</hi> then removed to <hi>New-Colledge</hi> in <hi>Oxon,</hi> where he was Fellow, and ſpent ſeveral years; being then taken notice of for his ſingular Gifts, and had in Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation by the moſt Learned and Godly in that Univerſity, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that account the more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently put upon Publick work. Being thence (the year after he had been Proctor) called over into <hi>Ireland</hi> to a conſtant pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Employment, he exerciſed his Miniſtry for about four or five years, not with the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only, but to the admiration of the moſt Wiſe and Judicious Chriſtians, and with the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent applauſe of ſuch as were of very different ſentiments from
<pb facs="tcp:136156:4"/>him in the things of Religion; Nay, even thoſe that never lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Piety, yet would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend his Learning and Gifts, as being beyond exception, if not abve compare. About the year 1660. being diſcharged from the publick exerciſe of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, he returned back into <hi>England,</hi> and in and about <hi>London</hi> ſpent the greateſt part of fifteen years, without any call to his old work in a ſetled way; but for about theſe five years laſt paſt hath been more known by his conſtant Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of which we need not ſpeak, but let them that heard him, ſpeak for him; or, if they ſhould be ſilent, his Works will do it. He was a Perſon of excellent Parts, ſtrong Reaſon great Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb facs="tcp:136156:4"/>and (which do not often go together) curious Phanſie, of high Improvements, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Learning, as having been all his days a moſt diligent and methodical Student, and a great Redeemer of time, reſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not only his reſtleſs hours in the Night, but his very walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time in the Streets from thoſe impertinencies and fruitleſs vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which do ſo cuſtomarily fill up mens minds, and ſteal away their hearts from thoſe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more Noble objects, which do ſo juſtly challenge their greateſt regards: This he did by not only carefully watching (as every good Chriſtian ſhould do) but conſtantly writing down his Thoughts, whereby he both go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd them better, and furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb facs="tcp:136156:5"/>himſelf with many materials for his moſt elaborate Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. His chief Talent was his Preaching Gift, in which, to ſpeak modeſtly, he had few equals. To this therefore, as that for which his Lord and Maſter had beſt fitted him (neglecting the practice of Phyſick, in which he had arrived at a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble meaſure of knowledge) he did eſpecially addict himſelf; and direct his Studies, and even when Providence denyed him opportunities, yet he was ſtill lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in more ſtock, and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for work againſt he might be called to it. When he was in Employment, none that heard him, could juſtly blame his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiredneſs, he being even when moſt private, continually at
<pb facs="tcp:136156:5"/>work for the Publick; and had he been leſs in his Study, he would have been leſs liked in the Pulpit. His Library, furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (tho not with a numerous, yet) a curious Collection of Books, was his Workhouſe, in which he laboured hard all the Week, and on the Lords Day made it appear he had not been idle; and that tho he conſulted his privacy, yet he did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge his Sloth. He was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what reſerved where he was not well acquainted; otherwiſe very free, affable and communicative where he underſtood and liked his company. He affected not much Acquaintance, becauſe be would eſcape Viſitants, well knowing how much the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſort of Friends were apt to
<pb facs="tcp:136156:6"/>take up of his time, which he could ill ſpare from his belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Studies, meeting with fevv that could give him better en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment vvith their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, than he could give himſelf alone. They had need be very good, and very learned, by whoſe converſe he could gain more than by his own Thoughts and Books. He was a true Son of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in that ſound Doctrine laid down in the Articles of Religion, and Taught by our moſt famous ancient Divines and Reformers; and a real follower of their Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as well as a ſtrenuous main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainer of the Truth they profeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. His Preaching was moſtly practical, yet rational and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentative, to his hearers under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings,
<pb facs="tcp:136156:6"/>as well as affections; and where controverſies came in his way, he ſhewed great A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteneſs and Judgment in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſing and determining them, and no leſs skill in applying them to practice: So that he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>a workman that needed not to be aſhamed,</hi> being <hi>able by ſound Doctrine, both to exhort and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince gain-ſayers.</hi> Some have thought his Preaching too high for vulgar Hearers, and it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denyed but his gifts were ſuited to the more intelligent ſort of Chriſtians; yet it muſt withal be ſaid, that if he were ſometimes deep, he was never abſtruſe; he handled the great Myſteries of the Goſpel with much clearneſs and perſpicuity; ſo that if in his Preaching he
<pb facs="tcp:136156:7"/>were above moſt, it was only becauſe moſt were below him. Several conſiderable Treatiſes on ſome of the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant points of Religion, he fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed in his ordinary courſe, which he hath left behind him, in the ſame form he uſually writ them for the Pulpit. This comes out firſt as a <hi>Prodromus</hi> to ſeveral others deſigned to be made publick, as ſoon as they can be with conveniency tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed, which (if the Lord will, and ſpare life) ſhall be atteſted with our hands; and whatever any elſe ſhall publiſh, can be but imperfect Notes (his own Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies being under our reviſal at the requeſt of his Friends) taken from him in the Pulpit, in which what miſtakes do often happen,
<pb facs="tcp:136156:7"/>every one knows, and we have found by experience in the caſe of this very Author, more than once. This was thought fit to be ſaid, to ſecure the reputation of the Dead, and prevent the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe of the Living. Theſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons might have come out with the ſolemn ceremony of large recommendations, the Authors worth being ſo well known to, his Preaching ſo highly eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the moſt eminent Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters about the City; but it was judged needleſs, his own <hi>works</hi> being ſufficient to <hi>praiſe</hi> him.</p>
            <p>One thing more is to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, That ſuch as he is here, ſuch he is in his other Pieces; ſo that thou haſt here, Reader, a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimen of the ſtrain and Spirit of this holy Man, this being his
<pb facs="tcp:136156:8"/>familiar and ordinary way of Preaching, and theſe Sermons coming out firſt, not as if they were the non-ſuch of what he left behind him, but becauſe they could ſooneſt be diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and to obviate the injuries might elſe be done by ſpurious Treatiſes, both to him, and thee; and likewiſe by this little taſt to gratifie the Appetites of ſuch who having been his Auditors, did long even with greedineſs to feaſt themſelves again upon thoſe excellent truths, which in the delivery were ſo ſweet to them. Perhaps too it may quicken their appetites who never heard him, it may be never yet heard of him. If thou like this Cluſter, Fear not but the Vintage will be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvverable: If this little earneſt
<pb facs="tcp:136156:8"/>be good Metal, the vvhole ſum vvill be no leſs currant. That a Bleſſing from Heaven may be upon this vvork, and upon thee in Reading, and Studying the Nature, and Beauty, and Ends of Divine Providence, and that the Lord of the Harveſt (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially vvhen ſo many are dayly called home) vvould ſend forth more and more <hi>ſuch</hi> labourers into the Harveſt, is the hearty prayer of.</p>

            <p>IN the beginning of the Chapter you find <hi>Baaſha</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> raiſing walls about, and Fortifying <hi>Ramah,</hi> a place about twelve miles from <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> the Metropolis of <hi>Judah,</hi> intending by that means to block <hi>Aſa</hi> up, becauſe <hi>Ramah</hi> lay juſt upon the road between <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Samaria,</hi> the ſeats of the two Kings, <hi>ver.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Baaſha</hi> was probably afraid of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to <hi>Judah,</hi> upon that Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Religion wrought by <hi>Aſa,</hi> and therefore would Fortifie that place to be a hinderance, and to intercept any that

            <p>Before I come particularly to explain the Providence of God, I ſhall lay down ſome Propoſitions as the Foundations of this Doctrine.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>God hath an indiſputable and peculiar Right to the Government of the World:</hi> None ever queſtion'd Gods Right, no nor his act, but thoſe that were ſwelled with an unreaſonable ambition, ſuch as <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar,</hi> who for this cauſe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went the puniſhment of a 7 years baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the ſociety of men.</p>
            <p>None indeed that acknowledg a God,<note n="*" place="margin">Dan. <hi>4.17.</hi>
               </note> did or can queſtion Gods Right, though they may queſtion his Will, an actual exerciſe of his Right. He is the Creator, and therefore is the Soveraign Lord and Ruler. The World is his Family, and as a Maſter, he hath an undoubted Right to govern his own Family. He gave all creatures their beings, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath a right to enact their laws, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point their ſtations, and fix their ends. 'Tis as much his property and preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to rule, as it is to create. Creation is ſo peculiarly proper to God, that it is not communicable to any creature, no not to Angels, though of a vaſt Capacity
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:136156:13"/>in other things, and that becauſe they are Creatures themſelves. 'Tis as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for one creature or all to govern the World, and manage all the boyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous paſſions of men to juſt and glorious ends, as to create them. 'Tis true, God uſeth inſtruments in the executive part of his Providence; but he doth not deſign the Goverment of the world only by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments. He uſeth them not for neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but ornament. He Created the World without them, and therefore can Govern the World without them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Virtus Creativa eſt fundamentum provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentiae &amp; argumentum ad providentiam.</hi> This right is founded upon that Creation, as he is the efficient cauſe of it. This right is alſo founded upon the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his Being. That which is excellent having a right to rule in the way of that excellency, that which is inferior; every man hath a natural right to rule another in his own art and skill wherein he excells him: If it be the right of a chief Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to manage the concerns of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, with what reaſon can we deny that right to God?</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>God only is qualified for the univerſal
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:136156:14"/>government of the World.</hi> All Creatures as they were unable to create themſelves, ſo are unable to manage themſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Direction of a Superior power, much more unable to manage the vaſt body of the world. God is only fit in regard of</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Power; Conſervation</hi> is <hi>continuata Creatio;</hi> that power which is fit to Create, is only ſit to preſerve. A continued Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion belongs as much to Omnipotency, as the firſt Creation.</p>
            <p>The Government of it requires no leſs power, both in regard of the numerouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the objects, and the ſtrange con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety of paſſions in rational creatures, and qualities in irrational; conſervation is but one continued act with creation, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing on from an inſtant to duration, as a line from its Mathematical point<note n="*" place="margin">

               </note>.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Holineſs and righteouſneſs.</hi> If <hi>he that hates right</hi> is not fit to govern, <hi>Job</hi> 34.17. then he that is infinitely Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and hath an infinite love to Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, is the fitteſt to undertake that task; without Righteouſneſs there would be nothing but confuſion in the whole creation; Diſorder is the effect of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:136156:14"/>as order is the effect of juſtice. The juſteſt man is fitteſt for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Government among men, and the infinite juſt God is fitteſt for the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Government of the World.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Knowledge.</hi> An infinite knowledge to deſcry all the contrivances and various labyrinths of the hearts of men, their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret intentions and aims, is neceſſary. The Government of the World conſiſts more in ordering the inward faculties of men, touching the hearts, and tuning them to play what notes he pleaſes, than in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal things. No creature hath the skill or power to work immediately upon the will of man; neither Angels nor Devils can do it immediately, but by propoſing objects, and working upon the fancy, which is not alwaies ſuccesful. He that created the heart, knows all the wards of it, and hath only the skill to turn it, &amp; incline it as he pleaſes; he muſt needs know all the inclinations of the creatures, and their proper activities, ſince he alone con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred all thoſe ſeveral principles and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities upon them.<note n="*" place="margin">Act. <hi>15.8.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world, viz.</hi> the particular natures,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:136156:15"/>inclinations, inward motions, which no creature fully underſtands; he needs no deputy to inform him of what is done, he is every where, and ſees all things: Worldly Governours cannot be every where eſſentially preſent.</p>
            <p>God is ſo perfect in his knowledge of all things, that he cannot be impoſed upon by the evil ſuggeſtions and flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of men or Angels.</p>
            <p>In nature it is ſo, the eye guides the body, becauſe that is the chief Organ of ſenſitive knowledg; the mind, which is the ſeat of Wiſdom guides the whole.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Patience.</hi> Infinite patience is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to the preſervation and government of the World in the circumſtances where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it hath ſtood ever ſince the fall: What Angel, though the meekeſt, or can all the Angels in Heaven be Maſters of ſo much patience as is needful for this work of governing the World, though for the ſpace of one day? Could they bear with all thoſe evils which are committed in the world in the ſpace of 24 hours? Might we not reaſonably conceive that they would be ſo tired with the obliqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, diſorders, deformities which they
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:136156:15"/>would ſee in the acts of men, (beſides all the evil which is in the hearts of men, which lye without the verge of their knowledg) that they would rather call for fire from Heaven to burn the world to Aſhes.</p>

               <hi>Averroes</hi> thought, that becauſe of Gods ſlowneſs to anger, he meddled to with ſublunary concerns: This rather fits him for it, becauſe he can bear with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries of wicked men, otherwiſe the world would not continue a moment.</p>
            <p>Angels, though powerful, holy, wiſe and patient creatures, yet being creatures, they want the infiniteneſs of all theſe qualifications which are neceſſary to this government: Though they are know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet they know not mens hearts; though they are wiſe, yet they may be charged with a folly uncapable of this; though holy, yet not able in this reſpect to manage it to the ends and deſigns of an infinite holineſs; though nimble, yet cannot be in all parts of the world at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry turn: but the Providence of God is infallible, becauſe of his infinite Wiſdom; indefatigable, becauſe of his Omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and righteous, bcauſe of his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <pb n="14" facs="tcp:136156:16"/>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>There can be no reaſon rendred why God ſhould not actually govern the World,</hi> ſince He only hath a right and a fitneſs. If God doth not actually govern it, it is either becauſe He cannot, or becauſe He will not.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Not becauſe He cannot;</hi> this inability muſt be either for want of knowledge, or want of power. The one if aſſerted, would deny his Omnipotence, the other his Omniſcience; the one would make him a weak God, the other an ignorant God, and conſequently no God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Not becauſe He will not.</hi> If He can and will not, it is, ſay ſome, a teſtimony of envy, that he maligns the good of his creatures. But not to inſiſt upon this; This muſt be either becauſe of the</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Difficulty,</hi> This cannot be: What difficulty can there be in a ſingle word, or one Act of his will, which can be done by God without any moleſtation, were there millions of Worlds as well as this? For ſtill they would be finite, and ſo governable by an infinite Superior. May we not more reaſonably think the forming ſuch a Maſs would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire more <hi>pains</hi> than the government of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:136156:16"/>it? The right ſtringing an inſtrument is more trouble to a ſkilful Muſitian, than the tripping over the ſtrings afterwards to make an harmony. What difficulty can it be to Omnipotence? Is it a greater labour to preſerve and govern, than it was to create / Doth not the Soul order every part of the body, and all its functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons without any pain to it? and ſhall not the God that made that Soul ſo indefati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable, much more manage the concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the World without labour to himſelf? Is it not as eaſie with God to guide all theſe things by one ſingle act of his Will, as for me by an act of my Soul to do many things without a diſtinct act of cogitation or conſideration before? Can it be more laborious to him, to govern the world, than it is to know all things in the world? He ſees all things in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant by one act of his underſtanding, and he orders all creatures in a moment by one act of his will. Can one act of his will be more painful, than one act of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding? Can he with a word make this great Ball, and can he not with as much eaſe order all to conform to the law of his own righteous will? Can a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:136156:17"/>eruption of goodneſs be a difficulty to an infinite Being, which we find natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to the Sun, to the Fountains, to the Sea, to many works of that Omnipotent Goodneſs? Or,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Diſparagement.</hi> Denial of Gods Providence over the leſſer things of the World, did ariſe from the conſideration of the ſtate of Monarchs, who thought it an abridgment of their felicity and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to ſtoop to ſuch low conſiderations as the <hi>minutula</hi> of their eſtates might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act</p>
            <p>from them, but left them to their Vicegerents. But they conſider not, that the felicity of God as it reſpects the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is to communicate his goodneſs to as many ſubjects as he hath made capable of his care. If it were his glory to create the world, can it be his diſhonour to govern it? The glorifying his Wiſdom is as honourable to him as the magnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Power; though both are eminent in Creation and Providence, yet his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is more ſignal in the Governing, as his Power was in framing of the world.</p>
            <p>Why was it not as much a diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to God to create things contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in our eyes, as ſince he hath created
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:136156:17"/>them to take care of them, and marſhal them for his own glorious ends. The Sun in the Heavens is a ſhadow of God, which doth not diſdain to communicate its natural goodneſs, and emit its beams to the meaneſt Creatures, and let the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle flies ſport themſelves in them, as well as the greateſt Princes: and tranſmits its influences upon things obſcure and at a diſtance from it, whereby it manifeſts an univerſal regard to all. And would it not be a diſparagement to an infinite goodneſs to be out ſtript by a Creature which he hath ſet up for a natural com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of goodneſs to the reſt of the World? The very conſideration of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and the nature of it, gives us as much an account of God, as any inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate being whatſoever: 'Tis as much the Suns honour to produce aſmall Inſect, as the growth of the greateſt Plant.</p>
            <p>Have not all Creatures a natural af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in them to preſerve and provide for their own? hath not God much more, who endued all creatures with that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition? Whatſoever is a natural per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in creatures, is eminently an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite perfection in God. If it be therefore a praiſe to you to preſerve
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:136156:18"/>your own, can it be a diſgrace to God? You may as well ſay, it is as much a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour to him to be good, as to have a tender regard to his creatures. Cenſure him as well, you may, for creating them for your delight, as preſerving and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning them for the ſame end. They are all good, for he pronounced them ſo, and being ſo, a God of goodneſs will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count them unworthy of his care. Are they now the Products of his Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Wiſdom, and ſhall not they be the objects of his directing wiſdom? If they are not unworthy of God to create, how can they be unworthy of God to govern them?

            <p n="4">4.<note place="margin">Fourthly.</note> Therefore, <hi>God doth actually preſerve and govern the world;</hi> though Angels are in Miniſtry in ſome particular works of his providence, yet God is the Steerſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who gives out his particular orders to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jacobs</hi> Ladder had the top in Heaven, where God ſtood to keep it firm: Its foot on Earth, and the Angels going up and down upon ſeveral errands at their Maſters beck.</p>

            <p>As God made all things for himſelf, ſo he orders the ends of all things made by him, for his own glory. For being the moſt excellent and intelligent agent, he doth reduce all the motions of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to that end for which he made them.</p>
            <p>This actual government of the World by God, brancheth it ſelf out in three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Nothing is acted in the World with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Gods knowledge.</hi> The viſion of the <hi>Wheels</hi> in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> preſents us with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent portraiture of Providence, there are eyes round about the wheels<note n="‡" place="margin">

               </note>.</p>
            <p>The ey of God is upon the whole cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the creatures motion. In all the revolutlons in the world, there is the Eye of Gods Omniſcience to ſee them, and the arm of his Omnipotence to guide them: Not the moſt retired corner, or the darkeſt cell, not the deepeſt cavern, or moſt inward project, nor the moſt ſecret wickedneſs, not the cloſeſt good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but the eye of the Lord beholds it,<note n="†" place="margin">Pro. 15.3.</note> 
               <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.3. <hi>The eyes of the Lord are in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very place, beholding the evil and the good.</hi> He hears the words, ſees the actions, knows the thoughts, regiſters the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:136156:19"/>diſcourſes, bottles up the penitent tears, and conſiders all the ways of men; not a whiſpered Oath, not an Atheiſtical thought, though but only peeping upon the heart, and ſinking down again in that maſs of corruption; not a diſorderly word, but he knows and marks it. The Soul hath a particular knowledge of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very act, becauſe it is the ſpring of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry act in any member; and nothing is done in this little World, but the Soul knows it. Surely, then there is not an act done in the world, nor the motion of any creature, but as God doth concur to it, he muſt needs know what he doth concur to. The knowledg and ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every thing is far leſs to the infinite being of God, than the knowledg and ordaining every motion of the body is to a finite Soul.</p>
            <p>Or, Suppoſe a Soul cloathed with a body of as big a proportion as the matter of the whole creation, it would actuate this body, tho of a greater bulk, and know every motion of it. How much more God, who hath infinity, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and ſtrength of all Angels and Souls, muſt needs actuate this world, and know every motion of it? There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:136156:19"/>done in the World, but ſome crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or other knows it; he that acts it, doth at leaſt know it: If God did not know it, the creatures then in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular knowledge would be ſuperiour to God, and know ſomething more than God knows; can this be peſſible?</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Nothing is acted in the World with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the will of God.</hi> His Will either com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands it, or permits it<note n="*" place="margin">

            <p n="3">3. <hi>Nothing doth ſubſiſt without Gods care and power.</hi> His eyes running to and fro, implies not only knowledge, but care.

            <p>If all things were done by chance, there could be no predictions of future things, which we frequently find in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and by what ways accompliſhed. Impoſſible it is that anything can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued without his care. If God ſhould in the leaſt moment withhold the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his Providence, we ſhould melt into nothing, as the impreſſion of a Sea upon the water, vaniſhes, as ſoon as the Seal is removed, or as the reflection of the face in the glaſs diſappears upon the firſt inſtant of our removal from it. The light in the air is by participation of the light of the Sun; The light in the air withdraws upon the departure of the Sun.

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The honour of his goodneſs.</hi> It ſhews the comprehenſiveneſs of his goodneſs, which embraceth in the arms of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, the loweſt Worm, as well as the higheſt Angel.

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:136156:24"/>good in his kind, good in themſelves, good in order to the end for which he created them; 'tis therefore an honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing for his goodneſs to conduct them to that end, which in their creation he deſign'd them for; and not leave them to wild diſorders unſutable to the end of that goodneſs which firſt called them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to being. If he grow out of love with the operations of his hands, he would ſeem to grow out of love with his own goodneſs that formed them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The honour of his Power and Wiſdom.</hi> The Power of God is as much ſeen in making an inſect full of life and ſpirit in all the parts of it, to perform all the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſuitable to its life and nature, as in making creatures of a greater bulk; and is it not for the honour of his power to preſerve them, and the honour of his Wiſdom to direct theſe little animals to the end he intended in their creation? for as little as they ſeem to be, an end they have, and glorious too, for <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra nihil facit fruſtra.</hi> It ſeems not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with his wiſdom to neglect that which he hath vouchſafed to create. And though the Apoſtle ſeems to deny Gods care of Brutes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. <hi>Doth God take
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:136156:25"/>care for Oxen?</hi> 'Tis true God did not in that Law only take care of <hi>Oxen, i.e.</hi> with a legiſlative care, as making a Law only for them, though with a providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial care he doth; but the Apoſtle there doth not deny Gods care for Oxen, but makes an argument <hi>a minori ad majus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Providence extends to all the actions and motions of the Creature.</hi> Every <hi>ſecond</hi> cauſe implies a dependance upon a <hi>firſt</hi> cauſe in its operation.

The proceed of all things depends upon his goodneſs in bleſſing, and his power in preſerving. God ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied this, when he gave the Law from Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> promiſing the People, that if they kept his Commandments, he would give them rain in due ſeaſon, and that the Earth ſhould bring forth her Fruit<note n="*" place="margin">

Evidencing thereby, that thoſe natural cauſes can produce nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his bleſſing; that though they have natural principles to produce ſuch Fruits according to their natures, yet he can put a ſtop to their operations, and make all their Fruits abortive. He weighs the waters, how much ſhall be poured out in ſhowrs of rain upon the parched earth. He makes a decree for the rain, and gives the Clouds a Commiſſion to diſſolve themſelves ſo much and no more<note n="*" place="margin">Job 28.23; 24, 25, 26.</note>. Yea,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:136156:26"/>he doth order the conduct of them by counſel, as imploying his wiſdom about theſe things which are of concern to the World. <hi>Job</hi> 37.11, 12. <hi>He ſcattereth his bright cloud, and it is turned round about by his counſels, that they may do whatſoever he commands them upon the face of the world in the earth.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>In permitting them to be done.</hi> Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries and follies of the Heathen were permitted by God. He checked them
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:136156:28"/>not in their courſe, but laid the reins up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their necks, and ſuffered them to run what race they pleaſed, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.16. <hi>Who in times paſt ſuffered all nations to walk in their own wayes.</hi> Not the moſt execrable villany that ever was committed in the world, could have been done without his permiſſion. Sin is not <hi>amabile propter ſe,</hi> and therefore the permiſſion of it is not deſirable in it ſelf, but the permiſſion of it is only deſirable, and <hi>honeſtaturex fine.</hi> God is good and wiſe and righteous in all his acts; ſo likewiſe in his act of permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſin: and therefore he wills it out of ſome good and righteous end, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the manifeſtation of his glory, which is that he intends in all the acts of his will; of which this is one. Wicked men are ſaid to be a ſtaff in Gods hand; as a man manages a ſtaff which is in his own power, ſo doth God manage wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men for his own holy purpoſes, and they can go no further than God gives them licenſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>In ordering them.</hi> God governs them by his own unſearchable Wiſdom and Goodneſs, and directs them to the beſt and holieſt ends. Contrary to the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:136156:29"/>natures of the ſins, and the intentions of the ſinner. <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s brothers ſold him to gratifie their revenge, and God order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it for their preſervation in a time of famine. <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s hardneſs is ordered by God for his own glory, and that Kings deſtruction: God decrees the delivering up Chriſt to death, and <hi>Herod, Pilate,</hi> the Phariſees and common rout of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in ſatisfying their own paſſion, do but execute what God had before ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Act. 4.28. <hi>For to do whatſoever thy hand and thy counſel determined before to be done. Judas</hi> his covetouſneſs and the Devils malice are ordered by God to execute his decree for the redemption of the World. <hi>Titus</hi> the Emperour, his ambition led him to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but Gods end is the fulfilling of his threatnings, and the taking revenge upon the <hi>Jews</hi> for their murdering of Chriſt. The aim of the Phyſician is the Patients health, when the intent of the Leeches is holy to ſuck the blood. God hath holy ends in permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſin, while man hath unworthy ends in committing it. The rain which makes the Earth fruitful, is exhaled out of the Salt-waters, which would of themſelves
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:136156:29"/>ſpoil the ground, and make it unfruitful. <hi>The deceiver and the deceived</hi> are his, <hi>Job</hi> 12.16. Both the action of the Devil the Seducer, and of wicked men the ſeduced, are reſtrained by God within due bounds, in ſubſerviency to his righteous will <hi>[for with him is ſtrength and wiſdom.]</hi>
            </p>

The cleareſt ſight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Servants of God do not ſee the bottom of his works; the motion of Gods eyes is too quick for ours.</p>
            <p>

                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 30.14.</note> Man is a weak creature, and cannot trace or ſcent out the wiſdom of God.</p>
            <p>But this myſteriouſneſs and darkneſs of Providence adds a luſtre to it. As ſtones ſet in Ebony, though the grounds
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:136156:30"/>be dark, make the beauty and ſparkling the clearer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>His wayes are above human methods.</hi> Dark Providences are often the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work of ſome excellent piece he is about to diſcover to the world. His methods are like a plaited Picture, which on the one ſide repreſents a Negro, on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Beauty. He lets <hi>Sarahs</hi> womb be dead, and then brings out the root of a numerous Progeny. He makes <hi>Jacob</hi> a Cripple, and then a Prince to prevail with God; He gives him a wound, and then a Bleſſing. He ſends not the Goſpel till reaſon was nonpluſt, and that the world in that higheſt wiſdom it had at that time attained unto, was not able to arrive to the knowledge of God. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21. <hi>After that the world by wiſdom knew not God, it pleaſed God by the fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of preaching to ſave them that believe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>His ends are of a higher ſtrain than the aims of men.</hi> Who would have thought that the forces <hi>Cyrus</hi> raiſed againſt <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> to ſatisfie his own ambition, ſhould be a means to deliver the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and reſtore the Worſhip of God in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? God had this end, which <hi>Iſaiah</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:136156:30"/>prophecyed of, and <hi>Cyrus</hi> never dreamt of, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.28. <hi>That ſaith of</hi> Cyrus, <hi>thou art my Shepherd, and ſhalt perform all my pleaſure, even ſaying that</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>ſhall be built,</hi> &amp;c.* And this a long time before <hi>Cyrus</hi> was born:<note n="‡" place="margin">Iſa. 45.1.</note> 
               <hi>Pharoah</hi> ſent <hi>Iſrael</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in the very night, at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, the time prefixt by God; he could not keep them longer becauſe of Gods promiſe; he would not becauſe of Gods Plagues. God aims at the glorifying his truth, in keeping touch with his word. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> deſigns not the accompliſhing Gods will, but his deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from Gods judgements.</p>
            <p>There is an obſervable conſideration to this purpoſe, how Gods ends are far different from mans. <hi>Luke</hi> 2.1, 4. In the taxing the whole World by <hi>Auguſtus. Auguſtus</hi> out of pride to ſee what a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous people he was Prince of, would tax the whole world: Some tell us he had apointed the enrolling the whole <hi>Empire</hi> Twenty Seven years before the Birth of our Saviour, and had proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it at <hi>Tarracon</hi> in <hi>Spain:</hi> But ſoon after this proclamation, <hi>Auguſtus</hi> found a breaking out of ſome ſtirs, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:136156:31"/>deferred his reſolution to ſome other fit time, which was the very time of the birth of Chriſt. See now Gods wiſe diſpoſal of things, in changing <hi>Auguſtus</hi>'s reſolution, and deferring it till the Forty fourth year of his Reign, when Chriſt was ready to come into the World! And this by giving occaſion, yea neceſſitating <hi>Mary</hi> to come from <hi>Nazareth,</hi> where <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> dwelt, who perhaps being big with Child, without this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity laid upon her by the Emperors E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, would not have ventured upon the Journey to <hi>Bethlehem:</hi> there ſhe falls in travel, that ſo Chriſt the ſeed of <hi>David</hi> being conceived in <hi>Nazareth,</hi> ſhould be born at <hi>Bethlem,</hi> where <hi>Jeſſe</hi> lived, and <hi>David</hi> was born. How wiſely doth God order the ambition and pride of men to fulfil his own predictions, and to publiſh the truth of Chriſts birth of the ſeed of <hi>David?</hi> for the names of <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> were found in the Records of <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>Tertullians</hi> time?</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>God hath ſeveral ends in the ſame action. Jacob</hi> is oppreſt with Famine, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> enricht with plenty, but <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph's</hi> impriſonment is in order to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:136156:31"/>relief, and <hi>Pharaohs</hi> wealth; his Miſtreſſes anger flings him into a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. <hi>Joſeph</hi> is wronged, and hath Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity for a reward of his chaſtity. God makes it a ſtep to his advancement, and by this way brings him from a Captive to be a favourite. What is Gods end? Not only to preſerve the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Nation, but old <hi>Jacob</hi> and his <hi>Family.</hi> Was this all that God aimed at? No. He hath a further deſign, and lays the Foundation of ſomething to be acted in the future age. By this means <hi>Jacob</hi> is brought into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> leaves his poſterity there, makes way for that glory in the working of the future miracles for their deliverance, ſuch an action that the world ſhould continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ring of, and which ſhould be a type of the ſpiritual deliverance by Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>God has more remote ends than ſhort ſighted Souls are able to eſpy.</hi> God doth not eye only the preſent advantage of himſelf and his Creature, but hath an eye to his own glory in all, yea, in the very laſt ages of the world. In ſmall things, there are often great deſigns laid by God, and myſteries in the leaſt of his acts. <hi>Iſaac</hi> was delivered from his Fathers Sword,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:136156:32"/>when he was intentionally dead, to ſet forth to the World a type of Chriſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and a Ram is conducted thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by God, and entangled in the thickets and apointed to ſacrifice, whereby God ſets forth a type of Criſts death<note n="*" place="margin">Halls Contempl. p. 796.</note>. He uſeth the captivities of the people to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the bounds of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>The wiſe men were guided by a Star to Chriſt as King of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and come to pay homage to him in his infancy; when was the foundation of this remarkable event laid? Probably in <hi>Balaams</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy (<hi>Numb.</hi> 24.17. <hi>I ſhall ſee him, but not now: I ſhall behold him, but not nigh. There ſhall come a Star out of</hi> Jacob, <hi>and a Scepter ſhall riſe out of</hi> Iſrael, &amp;c.) tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by tradition to thoſe Wiſe men, and perhaps renewed by <hi>Sybylla Chaldaea,</hi> and confirm'd in their minds by the <hi>Jews,</hi> whilſt in the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> captivity they converſed with them. Thus God many ages before, in this prophecy had an end in promoting the readier entertainment of Chriſt among this people, when he ſhould be born; what the wiſe mens end was, the Scripture doth not acquaint us; but however, their gifts were a means to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:136156:32"/>preſerve our Saviour, <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> from the rage of a Tyrant, and affording them wherewithal to ſupport them in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> whither they were ordered by God to fly for ſecurity. So<note n="*" place="margin">2 King. 7-1, 2, 17.</note> God threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens by the Prophet the Noble-man for his ſcoffing unbelief, that though he ſhould ſee the plenty, that he ſhould not taſte of it. See how God doth order Second cauſes, naturally to bring about his own decree! The King gives this perſon charge of the gate, whilſt the people croud for proviſion to ſatisfie their hunger, they accompliſh the threatning which they had no intentions to do, and trod him to death. Now I come to ſhew, That there is a Providence,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Wiſdom of God would not be ſo perſpicuous, were there not a providence to the world.</hi> 'Tis eminent in the creation, but more illuſtrious in the Government of the creatures. A Muſician diſcovers more skill in the touching an inſtrument and ordering the ſtrings, to ſound what notes he pleaſeth, than he doth in the firſt framing and making of it.<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Iſa. 28.29.</hi> This alſo comes from the Lord of Hoſts, which is wonderful in Counſel and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in working.</note> All Gods providences are but his touchof the ſtring of this great inſtrument of the World.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:136156:33"/>And all his works are excellent, becauſe they are the fruit of his wonderful coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and unſearchable wiſdom, which is moſt ſeen in his providence, as in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the verſes before. His power is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified in creating and upholding this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick. How ſhall his wiſdom be glorified but in his government of it? Surely God will be no leſs intent upon the honour of his wiſdom, than upon that of his power. For if any Attribute may be ſaid to excel another, it is his Wiſdom and Holineſs, becauſe thoſe are perfections which God hath ſtampt upon the nobler part of his Creation. Inferior creatures have more power and ſtrength than man; but Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is the perfection of a rational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Now it is Gods wiſdom to direct all things to their proper end, as well as to appoint them their ends, which direction muſt be by a particular providence, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecialy in thoſe things which know not their end, and have no reaſon to guide them. We know in the World it is not a part of wiſdom to leave things to chance, but to ſtate our ends, and lay a platform of thoſe means which direct to an attaining of them. And Wiſdom is
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:136156:33"/>moſt ſeen in drawing all things together, and making them ſubſervient to the end he hath fixed to himſelf; and therefore one of the great things that ſhall be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired at laſt, next to the great work of redemption, will be the harmony and conſent of thoſe things which ſeem'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, how they did all conſpire for the bringing about that end which God aimed at.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The means whereby God acts,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Secondly.</note> 
               <hi>diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a providence.</hi> He acts</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>By ſmall means.</hi> The conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble actions in the World have uſually ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſmall beginnings. As of a few letters, how many Thouſand words are made? of Ten figures, how many Thouſand Numbers? And a point is the beginning of all Geometry. A little ſtone flung in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a pond, makes a little circle, then a greater, till it in largeth it ſelf to both the ſides. So from ſmall beginnings, God doth cauſe an efflux through the whole World.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>He uſeth ſmall means in his ordinary works.</hi> The common works of nature ſpring from ſmall beginnings. Great Plants are formed from ſmall ſeeds. The
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:136156:34"/>Clouds which water the great Garden of the World, are but a Collection of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours.

            <p n="2">2. <hi>In his extraordinary works he uſeth ſmall means.

            <p>In his extraordinary works of <hi>Juſtice.</hi> He makes a Rod in the hand of <hi>Moſes</hi> to confound the skill of the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians: He commiſſioned Froggs and Flyes to countercheck a powerful and mighty people.

Their wicked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was to be rid of him, that he might tell no more tales of them to his Father; Gods gracious intention was to advance him for his honour and their good; &amp; to bring about this gracious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, he makes uſe of their ſinful pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice. Gods end was righteous, when theirs was wicked. 'Tis ſaid, God mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>David</hi> to number the People, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.1. <hi>the anger of the Lord was kindled againſt Iſrael, and he moved David againſt them to ſay, Go number Iſrael and Judah.</hi> Yet Satan is ſaid to provoke <hi>David</hi> to; number the people, 1 Chron. 21.1. <hi>And Satan ſtood up againſt Iſrael, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked David to number Iſrael.</hi> Here are two agents; But the text mentions Gods hand in it out of Juſtice to puniſh <hi>Iſrael;</hi> Satans end, no queſtion, was out of malice to deſtroy. Satan wills it as a ſin, God as a puniſhment, God, ſay ſome, <hi>permiſſive;</hi> Satan <hi>effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citer.</hi> In the moſt villanous and unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous action that ever was done, God is ſaid to have an influence on it.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:136156:43"/>God is ſaid to deliver up Chriſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.23. <hi>Him, being delivered by the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate counſel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified and ſlain.</hi> Acts 4.28. <hi>for to do whatſoever thy hand and thy counſel deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined before to be done.</hi> Not barely as an act of his Preſcience, but his Counſel, and that determinate, <hi>i. e</hi> ſtable and irreverſible. He makes a diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe two acts. In God it was an act of Counſel, in them an act of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednſes <hi>[by wicked hands;]</hi> there was Gods counſel about it, an actual tradition. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. <hi>He that ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all.</hi> All the Agents had ſeveral ends. God in that act aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the redemption of the world; Satan at the preventing it; <hi>Judas</hi> to ſatisfie his covetouſneſs; the <hi>Jews</hi> to preſerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the <hi>Roman</hi> invaſion, and out of malice to him for ſo ſharply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving them. God had a gracious principle of love to mankind, and acted for the Salvation of the World in it; the inſtruments had baſe principles and ends, and moved freely in obedience to them. So in the affliction of <hi>Job,</hi> both
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:136156:43"/>God and Satan had an hand in it. <hi>Job</hi> 1.12. <hi>The Lord ſaid unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power, verſ.</hi> 11. <hi>touch all that he hath, and he will curſe thee to thy face;</hi> their ends were different, the one righteous for Tryal, the other mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious againſt God, that he might be cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and againſt <hi>Job</hi> that he might be damned. Gods end was the brightning of his grace, and the Devils end was the ruin of his integrity, and deſpoilng him of Gods favour.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>In all Gods acts about ſin, there is no ſtain to Gods holineſs</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Senguer. Metaph. lib. <hi>2.</hi> cap <hi>15.</hi> S. <hi>5.</hi>
               </note>. In ſecond cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, one and the ſame action proceeding from divers cauſes, in reſpect of one cauſe may be ſinful; in reſpect of the other, righteous. As when two Judges con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn a guilty perſon, one condemns him out of love to juſtice, becauſe he is guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; the other condemns him out of a private hatred and ſpleen: One reſpects him as a Malefactor only, the other as a private Enemy chiefly. Here is the ſame action with two concurring cauſes, one being wicked in it, the other righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Much more may we conceive it in the concurrence of the Creator, with
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:136156:44"/>the action of the Creature.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>God moves every thing in his ordinary providence according to their particular natures.</hi> God moves every thing ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly according to the nature he finds it in. Had we ſtood in innocency, we had been moved according to that originally righteous nature; but ſince our Fall we are moved according to that nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced by us with the expulſion of the other. Our firſt corruption was our own act, not Gods work; we owe our creation to God, our corruption to our ſelves. Now, ſince God will govern his creature, I do not ſee how it can be otherwiſe, than according to the preſent nature of the creature, unleſs God be pleaſed to alter that nature. God forces no man againſt his nature; he doth not force the will in converſion, but graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and powerfully inclines it. He doth never force nor incline the will to ſin, but leaves it to the corrupt habits it hath ſettled in it ſelf, Pſal. 81.12. <hi>So I gave them up to their own hearts luſts, and they walked in their own counſels;</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of their own framing, not of Gods. He moves the will which is <hi>ſponte mala,</hi>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:136156:44"/>according to its own nature &amp; counſels. As a man flings ſeveral things out of his hand, which are of ſeveral figures, ſome ſpherical, tetragons, cylinders, conicks, ſome round, and ſome ſquare; though the motion be from the agent, yet the variety of their motions is from their own figure and frame; and if any will hold his hand upon a ball in its moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, regularly it will move according to its nature and figure: and a man by caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a boul out of his hand, is the cauſe of the motion, but the bad biaſs is the cauſe of its irregular motion. The power of action is from God, but the viciouſneſs of that action from our own nature. As when a Clock or Watch hath ſome fault in any of the wheels, the man that winds it up, or putting his hand upon the wheels moves them, he is the cauſe of the motion, but it is the flaw in it, or deficiency of ſomething is the cauſe of its erroneous motion; that error was not from the Perſon that made it, or the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that winds it up, and ſets it on go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but from ſome other cauſe, yet till it be mended it will not go otherwiſe, ſo long as it is ſet upon motion. Our moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:136156:45"/>is from God [Acts 17.28. <hi>In him we move</hi>] but not the diſorder of that moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 'Tis the foulneſs of a mans ſtomach at Sea is the cauſe of his ſickneſs, and not the Pilots government of the ſhip.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>God doth not infuſe the luſt or excite it,</hi> though he doth preſent the object a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which the luſt is exerciſed. God delivered up Chriſt to the <hi>Jews,</hi> he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him to them; but never command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to crucifie him, nor infuſed that malice into them, nor quickned it; but he ſeeing ſuch a frame, withdrew his reſtraining grace, and left them to the conduct of their own witiated wills. All the corruption in the World ariſeth from luſt in us, not from the object which God in his providence preſents to us. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4 <hi>the corruption that is in the World through luſt.</hi> The Creature is from God, but the abuſe of it from corruption. God created the grape, and filled the Wine with a ſprightlineſs; but he doth never infuſe a drunken frame into a man, or excite it. Providence preſents us with the Wine, but the precept is to uſe it ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly. Can God be blamed, if that which is good in it ſelf, be turned into
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:136156:45"/>Poyſon by others? No more than the flower can be called a criminal, becauſe the Spiders nature turns that into venome which is ſweet in it ſelf. Man hath ſuch a nature, not from Creation, wherein God is poſitive; but from corruption, wherein God is permiſſive. Providence brings a man into ſuch a condition of poverty, but it doth not encourage his ſtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and impatience. There is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity upon thee from God to exerciſe thy ſin under affliction, when others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame exerciſe their graces. The Rod makes the Child ſmart, but it is its own ſtubbornneſs makes it curſe. In ſhort, though it be by Gods permiſſion that we <hi>can</hi> do evil, yet it is not by his inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that we <hi>will</hi> to do evil, that is wholly from our ſelves.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>God ſupports the faculties wherewith a man ſinneth, and ſupports a man in that act wherein he ſinneth, but concurrs not to the ſinfulneſs of that act.</hi> No ſin doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly conſiſt in the act it ſelf, as an act; but in the deficiency of that act from the rule. No action wherein there is ſin, but may be done as an action, though not as an irregular action. Killing a man
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:136156:46"/>is not in it ſelf unlawful, for then no Magiſtrate ſhould Execute a Malefactor for murdering another, and juſtice would ceaſe in the World; man alſo muſt diveſt himſelf of all thoughts of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving his Life againſt an invader; but to kill a Man without juſt cauſe, without authority, without rule, contrary to rule, out of revenge, is unlawful. So that it is not the act, as an act, is the ſin, but the ſwerving of that act from the rule, makes it a ſinful act: So ſpeaking, as ſpeaking, is not a ſin, for it is a power and act God hath endued us with; but ſpeaking irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verently and diſhonourably of God, or falſly and ſlanderouſly of man, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe irregularly, therin the ſin lyes. So that it is eaſie to conceive that an act and the viciouſneſs of it are ſeparable. That act which is the ſame in kind with another, may be laudable, and the other baſe and vile in reſpect of its circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The mind wherewith a man doth this or that act, and the irregularity of it, makes a man a criminal. There is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of God to the act wherein we ſin, but the ſinfulneſs of that act is purely from the inherent corruption of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:136156:46"/>As the power and act of ſeeing is communicated to the eye by the Soul, but the ſeeing doubly or dimly, is from the vitiouſneſs of the Organ, the eye. God hath no manner of immediate effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency in producing ſin; as the Sun is not the efficient cauſe of darkneſs, tho the darkneſs immediately ſucceeds the ſetting of the Sun, but it is the deficient cauſe. So God withdraws his grace, and leaves us to that luſt which is in our wills. <hi>Act</hi> 14.16. <hi>Who in times paſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered all Nations to walk in their own wayes.</hi> He beſtowed no grace upon them, but left them to themſelves. As a man who lets a glaſs fall out of his hand is not the efficient cauſe that the glaſs breaks, but its own brittle nature, yet he is the deficient cauſe, becauſe he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws his ſupport from it. God is not obliged to give us grace, becauſe we have made a total forfeiture of it. He is not a debtor to any man by way of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, of any thing but puniſhment. He is indeed in ſome ſence a debtor to thoſe that are in Chriſt upon the account of Chriſts purchaſe, and his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, but not by any merits of theirs.</p>
            <pb n="76" facs="tcp:136156:47"/>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Gods providence is converſant about ſin as a puniſhment, yet in a very righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous manner.</hi> God did not will the firſt ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> as a puniſhment, becauſe there was no puniſhment due to him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſinned; but he willed the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of it as a puniſhment to the nature <hi>ſub ratione boni.</hi> This being a judicial act of God, is therefore righteouſly willed by him. Puniſhment is a moral good. 'Tis alſo a righteous thing to ſuit the puniſhment to the nature of the offence; and what can be more righteous than to puniſh a man by that wherein he offends? Hence God is ſaid to give up men to ſin. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.26, 27. <hi>for this cauſe God gave them up unto vile affections.</hi> And <hi>to ſend ſtrong deluſions that they may believe a lye.</hi> And the reaſon is rendred 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.12. <hi>that they all might be damned, who believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not the truth, but had pleaſure in unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</hi> What more righteous than to make thoſe vile affections, and that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs their puniſhment, which they made their pleaſure, and to leave them to purſue their own ſinful inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp; make them (as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.10. <hi>fall by their own counſels?</hi> A
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:136156:47"/>Drunkards Beaſtlineſs is his puniſhment as well as his Sin. Thus God delivers up ſome to their own luſts as a puniſhment both to themſelves and others. As he hardened <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart for the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction both of himſelf and his People.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>God by his providence draws glory to himſelf, and good out of ſin.</hi> 'Tis the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt excellency to draw good out of evil; and it is Gods right to manifeſt his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency when he pleaſes, and to direct that to his honour, which is acted againſt his Law. The Holineſs of God could never intend Sin as Sin. But the Wiſdom of God foreſeeing it, and decreeing to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it, intended the making it ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to his own honour. He would not permit it but for ſome good, becauſe he is infinitely good, and could not by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that goodneſs, ſuffer that which is purely evil, if by his Wiſdom he could not raiſe good out of it: 'Tis purely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil as it is contrary to Law; It is good <hi>ratione ſinis</hi> as God orders it by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; yet that goodneſs flows not from the nature of ſin, but from the wiſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of God.</p>
            <p>As God at the Creation framed a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:136156:48"/>world out of a <hi>Chaos,</hi> out of matter without form, and void: So by his infinite wiſdom he extracts honour to himſelf, out of the ſins of men. As ſin had diſhonoured him at its entrance, in defacing his works, and depraving his creature: So he would make uſe of the ſins of men in repairing his honour, and reſtoring the creature.</p>
            <p>'Tis not conceivable by us, what way there could be more congruous to the Wiſdom and Holineſs of God, as the ſtate of the World then ſtood, to bring about the death of Chriſt, which in his decree was neceſſary to the ſatisfaction of his juſtice, without ordering the evil of ſome mens hearts to ſerve his gracious purpoſe. If we could ſuppoſe that Chriſt could commit ſome capital crime for which he ſhould deſerve death, which was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by reaſon of the hypoſtatical union, the whole deſign of God for redemption had ſunk to the ground. Therefore God doth reſtrain or let out the fury of mens paſſions, and the corrupt habits of their wills to ſuch a degree as ſhould anſwer directly to the full point of his moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious will, and no further. He lets out
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:136156:48"/>their malice ſo far as was conducing to the grand deſign of his death, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains it from every thing that might im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the truth of any prediction, as in the parting his garments, or breaking his bones. If God had put him to death by ſome thunder or otherwiſe, and after raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, how could the voluntarineſs of Chriſt appear, which was neceſſary to make him a perfect oblation? How would his innocency have appeared? The ſtrangeneſs of the judgment would have made all men believe him ſome great and notorious ſinner. How then could the Goſpel have been propagated? Who would have entertained the Doctrine of one, whoſe innocency could not be cleared? If it be-ſaid, <hi>God might raiſe him again,</hi> what evidences would have been had, that he had been really dead? But as the caſe was, his Enemies confeſs him dead really, and many Witneſſes there were of his reſurrection.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>God orders the ſins of men to the glory of his grace.</hi> As a foil ſerves to make the luſter of a Diamond more conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; ſo doth God make uſe of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formities
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:136156:49"/>of men to make his own grace more illuſtrious, and convey it with a more pleaſing relliſh to them. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver doth grace appear more amiable, never is God entertained with ſo high admirations, as by thoſe who of the worſt of ſinners are made the choiceſt of Saints: <hi>Paul</hi> often takes occaſion from the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his ſin, to admire the unſearchable riches of that grace which pardoned him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>God orders them to bring forth tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral mercies.</hi> In Providence there are two things conſiderable. Firſt, <hi>Mans Will.</hi> 2. <hi>Gods Purpoſe.</hi> What mans will intends as a harm in ſin, God in his ſecret purpoſe orders to ſome eminent advantage. In the ſelling of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> his Brothers intend the execution of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge; And God orders it for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of himſelf, and the preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his unrighteous Enemies, who might otherwiſe have ſtarved. His Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſent him to fruſtrate his dream, and God to fulfil it. Our reformation and return from under the yoke of Antachriſt, was by the wiſe diſpoſal of God occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the three great Idols of the world, the luſt of the Eye, the luſt of the Fleſh,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:136156:49"/>and the pride of life; luſt, covetouſneſs and ambition, three vices notoriouſly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent in <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument in that work. What he did for the ſatisfaction of his Luſt is order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God for the glory of his mercy to us. And though the Papiſts upon that account reflect upon our Reformation, they may as well reflect upon the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous work of Redemption, becauſe it was in the wiſdom of God brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout by <hi>Judas</hi> his covetouſneſs, and the <hi>Jews</hi> malice.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>God orders them for the glory of his Juſtice upon others. Nathan</hi> had threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>David,</hi> that one of his own houſe ſhould lye with his Wives in the ſight of the Sun<note n="*" place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.11.</note>

            <p n="3">3. <hi>Future glory.</hi> The great enquiry at the day of Chriſt's appearing, will be, How good men bear their ſufferings, what improvements they had; and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er their purity by them, the greater will be their praiſe and honour. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.7. <hi>That the tryal of your faith</hi> [viz. by mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Temptations] <hi>may be found to praiſe, and honour, and glory, at the appearing of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> For a good improvement by them, they will have a Publick praiſe from God's mouth, and a Crown of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour ſet upon their heads. Providence ſends even light afflictions as ſo many Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers, to make the Crown more Maſſy, and more bright, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. <hi>[Works for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.]</hi> They are at work about a good man's Crown, while they make him ſmart. They prepare him for heaven, and make it more grateful to him when he comes to poſſeſs it. A Chriſtians car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:136156:60"/>in them prepares for greater degrees of Glory. Every ſtroke doth but more beautifie the Crown.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Sufferings of good men for the Truth highly glorifies the Providence of God.</hi> This is a matter of glory and honour, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.16. <hi>If any man ſuffer as a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, let him not be aſhamed, but let him glorifie God on this behalf.</hi> They thereby bear a Teſtimony to the higheſt Act of providence that God ever exerciſed, even the redemption of the world by the blood of his Son. And the Church, which is the higheſt object of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the world, takes the deeper root, and ſprings up the higher; the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it was laid in the blood of Chriſt, and the growth of it is furthered by the blood of Martyrs. The carriage of the righteous in them, makes the Truth they profeſs more valued. It enhanceth the excellency of Religion, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts it to be more amiable for its beauty, than for its dowry; ſince they ſee it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable by the ſufferers, not only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out worldly enjoyments, but with the ſharpeſt miſeries. This conſideration hath wrought upon many to embrace the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:136156:61"/>Religion of the Sufferers. If it reaches as far as death, they are but diſpatched to their Fathers houſe, and the day of their death is the day of their Coronati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and what evil is there in all this?</p>
            <p>To conclude, This Argument is ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er (upon the infallible righteouſneſs of God's nature) for a day of Reckoning af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this life, than againſt Providence. 'Tis a more rational concluſion, That God will have a time to juſtifie the righteouſneſs and wiſdom of his Providential Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and repair the honour of the righteous, oppreſſed by the injuſtice of the wicked. And indeed, unleſs there be a retribution in another world, the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is unanſwerrble, and all the reaſon in the world knows not how to ſalve the Holineſs and Righteouſneſs of God in his Providential Diſpenſations in this life; ſince we ſee here Goodneſs unrewarded and debaſed to the dunghill, Vice glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in impunity, and ranting to the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament. We cannot ſee how it can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with the nature of God's Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs and Holineſs, if there were not another life wherein God will mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt his Righteouſneſs in the puniſhing ſin,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:136156:61"/>and rewarding goodneſs: For it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that a God of infinite Juſtice ſhould leave ſin unpuniſhed, and Grace unrewarded here or hereafter. The Scripture gives us ſo full an acount of a future ſtate, that may ſatisfie all Chriſtians in this buſineſs.</p>
            <p>The wicked rich man is in his Purple, and <hi>Lazarus</hi> in his rags; yet <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſom is prepared for the one, and an endleſs Hell for the other. <hi>Jeremy</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves the caſe in his diſpute with God about it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.3. <hi>Pull them out like ſheep for the ſlaughter, and prepare them for the day of ſlaughter.</hi> They are but fattening for the knife of juſtice; and the day will come when they ſhall be conſum'd, like the fat of Lambs in the Sacrifice, which ſhall wholly evaporate into ſmoke; ſo the Pſalmiſt reſolves it in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.20. a Pſalm written for the preſent caſe.

               <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.38. The whole maſs of them in one bundle. Who then will charge God with unequal diſtributions at that day which is appointed for the clearing up of his righteouſneſs, which is here maskt in the world? who can be fond of the State of the wicked? Who would be fond of a dead mans condition, becauſe he lies in State, whoſe Soul may be condemned, whilſt his body with a pompous ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is carried to the Grave; and both bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Soul joyned together at the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, adjudged to eternal miſery?</p>

               <hi>Q.</hi> 3. What hath been ſaid in this, will alſo anſwer another Queſtion, <hi>Why God doth not immediately puniſh notorious offenders,</hi> ſince the beſt governments in the world are ſuch as call the violaters of the Law to a ſpeedy account, to keep up the honour of Juſtice? Thus the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures</hi> charge God with neglects of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, becauſe if he doth puniſh wicked men, it is later than is fit and juſt; <hi>becauſe ſentence againſt an evil work is not executed ſpeedily, therefore the heart of the Sons of men is fully ſet in them to do evil.</hi> Eccleſ. 8.11. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay of Juſtice is an encouragement to Sin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. <hi>This is an argument for Gods
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:136156:62"/>patience, none againſt his providence.</hi> Should he make ſuch quick work, what would become of the world? Could it have held out to this day? If God had inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken revenge upon thoſe that thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parage his providence, the framer of ſuch an objection had not been alive. No man is ſo perfectly good, but he might fall under the revenging ſtroke of his ſword, if he pleaſed to draw it. Suffer God to evidence his patience here, ſince after the winding up of the World, he will have no time to manifeſt it. God doth indeed ſometimes ſend the ſharp ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of ſome judgment upon a notorious offender, to let him underſtand that he hath not forgotten how to govern; but he doth not alwayes do ſo, that his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence may be glorified in bearing with his rebellious creature.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>God is juſt in that wherein the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuppoſeth him unjuſt.</hi> He ſuffers wicked men to continue to be the plagues of the places where they live, and the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners of his Juſtice upon offenders againſt him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.13. The wicked are God's <hi>Sword. Jeremiah</hi> 47.6. Thoſe that God would ſtir up againſt the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:136156:63"/>are called the <hi>Sword</hi> of the Lord, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10.5. <hi>Aſhur</hi> is ſaid to be the <hi>Rod</hi> of his anger; would it conſiſt with his wiſdom to drop the inſtruments out of his hand, as ſoon as he begins to uſe them? To caſt his Rods out of his hand as ſoon as he takes them up? The rules of juſtice are as much unknown to us, as the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications of his goodneſs to his people are unknown to the world.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let me ask ſuch a one, <hi>whether he never injur'd another man? and whether he would not think it very ſevere, if not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, that the offended perſon ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently take revenge of him?</hi> If every man ſhould do the like, how ſoon would mankind be diſpatcht, and the World become a ſhambles, men running furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to one anothers deſtruction for the injuries they have mutually received? Do we praiſe the lenity of parents to their Children, and diſpraiſe the mercy of God, becauſe he doth not preſently uſe his right? Is then forbearance of revenge accounted a virtue in a man, and ſhall it be an imperfection in God? With what reaſon can we thus blame the eminent patience of God, which we have reaſon
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:136156:63"/>to adore, and which every one of us are monuments of? The uſe is,</p>

            <p>It will not be amiſs to conſider this; For the root of denial of providence is in the hearts of the beſt men, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under affliction. <hi>Aſah</hi> was a holy man; yet <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.13. ſaith he, <hi>Verily I have cleanſed my heart in vain, and waſhed my hands in innocence.</hi> He had taken much pains with his heart, and had been under much affliction.

And it is a greater crime in any of us to deny providence, either in opinion or practice, than it was or could have been in Heathens; becauſe we have not only that natural reaſon which they had, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to convince us, but ſupernatural revelation in the Scripture, wherein God hath declared thoſe methods of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence which reaſon could not arrive to.

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:136156:68"/>and condemn him as an unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous governour; and in <hi>Job</hi>'s anſwer you find no ſyllable or word of his integrity to God, but a ſelf abhorrency, <hi>Job</hi> 42.26. <hi>Wherefore I abhor my ſelf in duſt and aſhes.</hi> I doubt that from this ſecret root ariſe thoſe Speeches which we ordinarily have among men, <hi>what have I done that God ſhould ſo afflict me?</hi> Though in a ſerious way it is a uſeful queſtion tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to an enquiry into the ſin that is the cauſe of it. But I doubt ordinarily there is too much of a reflection upon God, as though they had deſerved other dealing at his hands. Take heed therefore of pride and conceits of our own worth, we ſhall elſe be led by it to diſparaging conceits of God, which indeed are the roots of all actions contradictory to God's Will.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It is founded upon pedantical and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual notions of God.</hi> As though it might detract from his pleaſure and delight, to look down upon this World; or, as though it were a moleſtation of an infinite Power, to buſie himſelf about the care of ſublunary things. They thought it unſutable to the felicity of God, that it
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:136156:69"/>would interrupt his pleaſure, and make a breach upon his bleſſedneſs. As though it were the felicity of a Prince not to take care of the Government of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, nor ſo much as provide for the well-being of his Children. I doubt that from ſuch, or as bad conceptions of God, may ſpring, ordinarily, our diſtruſt of God upon any diſtreſs. Take heed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of entertaining any conceptions of God, but what the Scripture doth furniſh you with.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Or elſe, this ſort of Atheiſm was uſher'd <hi>in by a ſtuttering conceit of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of God.</hi> They thought it unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the excellency of the divine Majeſty to deſcend to a regard of the petty things of the World; this ſeems to be the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.11. <hi>How doth God know? is there knowledge in the moſt high?</hi> They think him too high to know, too high to conſider. How unreaſonable is it to think God moſt high in place, and not in perfection; and if in perfection, not in knowledge and diſcerning? They imagined of him as of a great Prince, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his pleaſure upon the battlements of his palace, not beholding the Worms up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:136156:69"/>on the ground; muffled with Clouds, as Job 22.13, 14 <hi>How doth God know? can he judge through the dark clouds? thick clouds are a covering to him, that he ſees not, and he walks in the circuit of Heaven.</hi> We cannot indeed have too high apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of God's Majeſty and Excellency: But we muſt take heed of entertaining ſuperſtitious conceits of God, and ſuch as are diſhonourable to him, or make the grandeur and ambition of men, the meaſures of the greatneſs and Majeſty of God. Upon this root ſprung Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Idolatry, and the Worſhip of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> who according to the Heathens fancy, were Mediators between God and men. And I doubt ſuch a conceit might be the firſt ſtep to the introducing the Popiſh Saint-worſhip into the Chriſtian World: and this lies at the root of all our omiſſions of duty, or neglects of ſeeking God. Let us therefore have raiſed thoughts of God's Majeſty, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring thoughts of his condeſcention, who notwithſtanding his greatneſs, humbles himſelf to behold what is done upon the Earth. The Pſalmiſt ſets a pattern for both, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 113.5, 6.</p>

            <p n="4">4. <hi>From their wiſhes upon any gripes of conſcience.</hi> They found guilt ſtaring them in the face, and were willing to comfort themſelves with the embraces of this Doctrine, wherein they might find a ſecurity and eaſe to their proſtituted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and unabounded liberty in the ways of ſin. Thoſe in <hi>Zephaniah,</hi> were firſt ſettled upon their lees, and then to drive away all fears of puniſhment, deny God's government. Zeph. 1.12. <hi>The Lord will not do good, neither will he do evil.</hi> A brave liberty for a City to be without a Magiſtrate, a houſe without a Governour, a ſhip without a Pilot, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the mercy of winds and waves. A man to be without reaſon, that paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and luſt ſhould act their pleaſures; a Liberty that beaſts themſelves would not have, to be without a Shepherd and one to take care of them. Such wiſhes certainly there are in men upon a ſenſe of guilt: they wiſh for their own ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, there were no providential eye to inſpect them. Take heed therefore of guilt, which will draw you to wiſh God deprived of the goverment of the World, and all thoſe attributes which qualify him
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:136156:70"/>for it. The readineſs to entertain the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Satan, rather than the motions of the Spirit, implies a willingneſs in them that Satan might be the God of the World, who favours them in ſin, rather than the Creator who forbids it. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the fears of conſcience evidence a ſecret belief, in men, of a juſt providence, whatever means they uſe to ſtifle it; elſe why is man upon the commiſſion of ſome notorious ſinful act, afraid of ſome evil hap to betide him? Why is he reſtleſs in himſelf? There is no ſinner, unleſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly hardned, but hath ſome ſecret touch of conſcience upon notorious enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities: While the work of the Law is written in their heart, their conſcience will bear witneſs and accuſe them<note n="*" place="margin">

            <p n="3">3. The third thing is,<note place="margin">Thirdly.</note> 
               <hi>The various ways wherein men parctically deny providence, or abuſe it, or contemn it.</hi>

            <pb n="124" facs="tcp:136156:71"/>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>When we will walk on in a way contrary to checks of providenes.</hi> When we will run againſt the will of God manifeſted in his providence; we do deny his government, and refuſe ſubjection to him; when we will be peremptory in our reſolves againſt the declaration of God's will by his checks of providence, we contend with him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the government of us and our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Such a diſpute had <hi>Pharaoh</hi> with God, notwithſtanding all the checks by the plagues poored out upon him; he would march againſt <hi>Iſrael</hi> to take them out of God's hand into his own ſervice again, Exod. 15.9. <hi>The enemy ſaid, I will purſue, I will overtake, I will divide the ſpoil, my luſt ſhall be ſatisfied upon them, I will draw my ſword, my hand ſhall deſtroy them.</hi> Here is the will of man vaunting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the governour of the World, reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to diſpute God's Royalty with him in ſpight of all the blaſtings of his deſigns, and the ſmart blows he had had from that powerful arm, which coſt him and his ſubjects their lives; they would not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand till the taking off their wheels, but would run headlong into the Red Sea. A remarkable example of this is in
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:136156:71"/>a good man, not ſo peremptory in words, but in actions againſt the revelations of God's mind both by the Prophet and his Providence. <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> had made a league with <hi>Ahab</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 18.1, 2, 3.</note>, and God had ordered <hi>Mica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah</hi> to acquaint him with the ill ſucceſs of the affair they went about,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>ver.</hi> 16, 19.</note> which <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaphat</hi> found true, for his own life was in danger, he was hardly beſet by the Enemy upon a miſtake;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>ver.</hi> 31, 32.</note> he had an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent anſwer of prayer, for upon his cry he had a quick return; God engaged his providence over his enemies hearts for him, the Lord helped him,<note place="margin">ver. <hi>31.</hi>
               </note> and God moved them to depart from him. And for his conjunction and continuance in it againſt <hi>Mieajah</hi>'s propheſie, God ſends a Prophet to reprove him, 2 Chron. 19.2. <hi>ſhouldest thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate the Lord? therefore is wrath upon thee from the Lord;</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves him ſharply for this confederacy; yet <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> after he had a ſignal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in delivering him from another army, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.24. Yet after this he goes on in this way, 2 Chron. 20.35. <hi>after this, i. e.</hi> after a reproof by a Prophet, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ill ſucceſs in his league, after eminent
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:136156:72"/>care of God in his deliverance, after a ſignal freeing him from a dangarous inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in a miraculous way, he enters into a league with <hi>Ahab</hi>'s Son, as wicked as his Father, <hi>ver.</hi> 36. he joyned himſelf with him to make ſhips to go to <hi>Tarſhiſh;</hi> and after that a third Prophet is ſent to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove him, and the ſhips were broken, <hi>v.</hi> 37. Here is a remarkable oppoſition to checks of providence, and manifeſt decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of God's will, as if he would be the Commander of the World inſtead of God. <hi>Abner</hi>'s action is much of the ſame kind, who would make the houſe of <hi>Saul</hi> ſtrong againſt <hi>David,</hi> tho he knew and was ſatisfied that God had promiſed the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to <hi>David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>In omiſſions of prayer.</hi> One reaſon to prove the fools denying God's govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the world, is, that they call not upon the Lord. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.1, 4. <hi>The Lord looked down from heaven to ſee if there were any that did underſtand and ſeek God.</hi> 'Tis certainly either a denying of God's ſufficiency to help us, when we rather beg of every creature, than ask of God; or a charging him with a want of providence, as though he had thrown off all care of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:136156:72"/>worldly matters. 2 King 1.3. <hi>Is it not becauſe there is not a God in Iſrael, that you go to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron?</hi> Seeking to any thing elſe with a neglect of God, is a denying the care of God over his creature. Do we not in this caſe make our ſelves our own gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and Lords, as though we could ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt without him, or manage our own af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs without his aſſiſtance? If we did really believe there was a watchful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and an infinite powerful good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to help us, he would hear from us oftener then he doth. Certainly thoſe who never call upon him, diſown his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the world, and do not care whether he regards the Earth or no. They think they can do what they pleaſe, without any care of God over them. The reſtraining prayer is a caſting off the fear of God. Job 15.4. <hi>Thou caſteth off fear,</hi> why? <hi>and reſtraineſt prayer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God.</hi> The neglect of prayer ariſeth from a conceit of the uprofitableneſs of it. Job 21.15. <hi>What profit ſhould we have if we pray unto him?</hi> Which conceit muſt be grounded upon a ſecret notion of God's careleſneſs of the world; ſuch fruit
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:136156:73"/>could not ariſe, but from that bitter root. But the Prophet <hi>Malachi</hi> plainly expreſſes it, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.14. <hi>Ye have ſaid, it is in vain to ſerve God, and what profit is it that we have kept his ordinances?</hi> Whence did this ariſe, but from a denial of providence, upon the obſervation of the outward hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the wicked? <hi>ver.</hi> 15. <hi>And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedneſs, are ſet up; yea, they that tempt God are even delivered.</hi> Sometimes it riſeth from an apprehenſion that God in the way of his providence dealeth unjuſtly with us. A good Prophet utters ſuch a ſinful ſpeech in his paſſion, 2 King. 6.33. <hi>Behold, this evil is of the Lord, what ſhould I wait for the Lord any longer?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>When men will turn every ſtone to gain the favourable aſſiſtance of men in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, and never addreſs to God for his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection or bleſſing.</hi> When they never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire God to move the hearts of thoſe whoſe favour they court, as though pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence were an unuſeful and unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing in the World. It was the caſe of thoſe <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeaks of, Job 35.9, 10. <hi>they cry out by reaſon of the arm of the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but none ſaith, where is God my maker,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:136156:73"/>who gives ſongs in the night,</hi> &amp;c. none in the midſt of their oppreſſions and cryes under them, did conſider either the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God in the Creation, as he was their Maker, nor his providence in the government of the World, as he raiſed up men from low eſtates, and gave mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of cheerfulneſs even in a time of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. This was the charge God by his Prophet brought againſt <hi>Aſa,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.7. (before the text) <hi>Thou haſt relyed on the King of Syria, and not relyed on the Lord thy God, herein thou haſt done fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, v.</hi> 9. where he ſets a relyance on the Creature, and a relyance on God in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect oppoſition. In ſeveral caſes men do thus deny and put a contempt on God, as the governour of the World; when we will caſt about to find out ſome crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture reſuge, rather than have recourſe to God for any ſupply of our neceſſities. Doth not he ſlight his fathers care, that will not ſeek to him in his diſtreſs? This was <hi>Aſa</hi>'s Sin. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.12. <hi>in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe he ſought not to the Lord, but to the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> think, that one rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why <hi>Joſeph</hi> continued two years in priſon, was his confiding too much upon
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:136156:74"/>the Butler's remembrance of him, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt for his deliverance, which they ground upon the requeſt he makes to him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 40.14. <hi>but think on me when it ſhall be well with thee, and ſhew kindneſs to me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this houſe.</hi> I muſt confeſs the expreſſions are very urgent, being ſo often repeated, and ſeems to carry a greater conſidence at preſent in the arm of fleſh, than in God. We do not read that <hi>Joſeph</hi> prayed ſo earneſtly to God, though no doubt but being a good man he did: Methinks the ſetting down his requeſt with that repetition in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſeems to intimate a probability of the <hi>Jews</hi> conceit. Or alſo when we do ſeek to him, but it is out of a general be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of his providence and ſufficiency, not out of an actuated conſideration; or when we ſeek to him with colder affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions than we ſeek to Creatures, as if we did half deſpair of his ability or will to help us: as when a man thinks to get learning by the ſagacity of his own wit, his indefatigable induſtry, and never deſires with any ardent affection the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God upon his endeavours. When
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:136156:74"/>we lean to our own Wiſdom, we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt the providence of God, <hi>Pro.</hi> 3.5. <hi>truſt in the Lord with all thine heart, and lean not to thine own underſtanding.</hi> Truſt in God, and leaning to our own wiſdom, are oppoſed to one another as incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent; or when a man hath ſome great concern, ſuppoſe a ſuit at law, to think to carry his cauſe by the favour of friends, the help of his money, the eloquence of his advocate, and never intereſts God in his buſineſs: This is not to acknowledge God in thy wayes, which is the command, <hi>Pro.</hi> 6. <hi>in all thy waies acknowledge him,</hi> as though our works were not <hi>in the hand of God, Eccleſ.</hi> 9.1. This is to take them out of God's hand, and put them into the hands of men. To truſt in our wealth, it is to make God a dead and a ſtupid God, and diſown his providence in the beſtowing it upon us. The Apoſtle ſeems to intimate this in the oppoſition which he makes between <hi>uncertain riches</hi> and the <hi>living God</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17.</note>. Theſe and many more actions ſutable to them, are vertual denials of God's ſuperintendency, as though God had left off the government of the World to the wits, or rather follies
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:136156:75"/>follies of men. Theſe are to magnifie the things we ſeek to, above God, as the chief Authors of all our good. 'Tis to imagine him leſs careful than man, more inſufficient then man. 'Tis a departure from a full fountain to a ſhallow ſtream; not to deſire God's aſſiſtance, is either from ſome check of conſcience, that our buſineſs is ſinful, that we dare not inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt him in it; or a diſowning God's care, as if we could bide our counſels from him, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.15. <hi>Wo to them that ſeek deep to hide their counſel from the Lord, and they ſay, who ſeeth us? and who knoweth us?</hi>) an bring our buſineſs to paſs before he ſhall know of it; At leaſt it is a ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God's government, ſince we will not engage God by prayer in the exerciſe of it on our behalf, and diſdain to acquaint him with our concerns. 'Tis a reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon God's Wiſdom to do ſo, which the Prophet mentions with a wo. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 31.1, 2. <hi>Wo to them that go down to Egypt for help, but they look not to the holy one of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, yet he alſo is wiſe.</hi> It is a diſparagement of God's providential wiſdom, not to look to him in our concerns, yea, and of his righteouſneſs too, <hi>they look not to the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:136156:75"/>holy one of Iſrael.</hi> In this they neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard his Holineſs nor his Wiſdom. When we conſult not with him upon emergent occaſions, we truſt more to our own Wiſdom, Counſel and Sufficiency, than to God's, and ſet up our ſelves as our own Lords, and independent upon him, as though we could manage things accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our pleaſure.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>When upon the receiving any good, they make a more grateful acknowledgment to the inſtruments, than to God the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Author of it.</hi> As if God had no hand in beſtowing thoſe bleſſings upon them; as if the inſtruments had diſpoſſeſſed God of his governing providence, and engroſt it in their own hands. This men are guilty of, when they aſcribe their Wealth to their own wit and fortune; their health to their own care, or the Phyſician's skill; their learning to their own induſtry; their proſperity to their friends or merits. When men thus return their thank-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſecond cauſes, and aſcribe to them what is due to God, they give the glory of his providence to a miſerable creature. Thus was the fooliſh boaſting of the <hi>Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, Iſa.</hi> 10.13, 14. <hi>By the ſtrength of
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:136156:76"/>my hand I have done this, and by my wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, for I am prudent, for I have removed the bounds of the people,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>It was Belſhaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi>'s offence alſo, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5 23. <hi>thou haſt lifted up thy ſelf againſt the Lord of heaven, and praiſed the Gods of ſilver,</hi> as though they were the authors of all thy greatneſs; ſo <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.16. <hi>they ſacrifice to their net, and burn incenſe to their drag, becauſe by them their portion is fat.</hi> Alluding to thoſe that then worſhipped their warlike wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, and the tools whereby they had got their wealth, in the place of God, as the Heathen uſed to do<note n="*" place="margin">

'Tis as high Idolatry as that of the Heathens, in as much as it is a ſtripping God of the glory of his providential care, though the object to which we direct our acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments, is not ſo mean as theirs which was a ſtock or ſtone. But is it not the ſame injury to a perſon to rifle him of his goods to beſtow it upon a begger, as to give it to a Prince?<note n="*" place="margin">Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raut de diverſes religions.</note> 'Tis a depriving a man of his right: Yet, is not this ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry?

'Tis as if the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs a Prince ſhews to his ſubjects, ſhould be attributed to a Scullion in his Kitchin, rather than to himſelf.

And this contempt is the greater by how much the greater mercy we have received in a way of providence, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.8. <hi>ſhe did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oyl, and multiplyed her ſilver and gold, which they prepared for Baal.</hi> She that had moſt reaſon to know, becauſe ſhe had enjoyed ſo much; ſhe that had experience how by a ſtrong and mighty hand I brought her out of <hi>Egypt</hi> into the Land now poſſeſſed by her; She would not know that I gave her thoſe good things ſhe prepared for <hi>Baal.</hi> It would be a natural conſequent from this Scripture, that thoſe that employ the good things they enjoy upon their luſts,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:136156:77"/>do deny the providential goodneſs of God in their poſſeſſion and enjoyment of them, becauſe they prepare God's good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for their ſinful pleaſures, as though their own luſts had been the Authors of them; and alſo their inſtruments, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive too high and flattering thanks of this nature, are much like <hi>Herod,</hi> that tickled himſelf with the Peoples applauſe, that his voice was the voice of God, and not of man.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>When we uſe indirect courſes, and diſhoneſt waies to gain wealth or honour.</hi> This is to leave God, to ſeek relief at Hells gates, and adore the Devil's provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence above God's: When God doth not anſwer us, like <hi>Saul</hi> we will go to the witch of <hi>Endor,</hi> and have our ends by Hell, when Heaven refuſeth us. 'Tis a convenanting with the Devil, and ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up a bargain and agreement with Hell, and acknowledging Satan to be the God of the World. No man will doubt but in expreſs Covenants with the Devil, as Witches and Conjurers are reported to make, that the Devil ſhall give them ſuch knowledge, ſuch wealth, or bring them to ſuch honour; 'tis no doubt, I ſay,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:136156:77"/>but ſuch do acknowledge the Devil the God of the world, becauſe they agree by articles to have thoſe things conferred upon them by Satan, which are only in the power of God abſolutly to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe or beſtow. So when a man will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Sin to gain the ends of his ambition or covetouſneſs, does he not implicitely covenant with the Devil who is the head of ſinners, and ſet up his ſin in the place of God, becauſe he hopes to attain thoſe things by ſinful means which are only in the hand of God, and on whom he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can have a dependance? This is the Devil's deſign out of an enmity to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. He tempted Chriſt to be his own Carver, thereby to put him upon a diſtruſt of his Father's care of him, Matt. 4.3. <hi>Command that theſe ſtones be made bread,</hi> as though God could not provide for him; which deſign of the Devil is manifeſt by our Saviour's anſwer. This is to proſtitute Providence to our own luſts, and to pull it down from the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the World, to be a Lacky to our ſinful pleaſure; to uſe means which God doth prohibit, is to ſet up Hell to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern us, ſince God will not govern our
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:136156:78"/>affairs in anſwer to our greedy deſires. 'Tis to endeavour that by God's curſe which we ſhould only expect by God's bleſſing: For when God hath forbid ſinful wayes, ſeverely threatned them, perhaps curſed them in examples before our eyes, what is it but to ſay, that we will rather believe God's curſe will further us, than his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing? 'Tis to diſparage his bleſſing, and prefer his curſe; to ſlight his wiſdom, and adore our folly. When we go out of God's way, we go out of God's protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we have no Charter for the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of providence without that conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.3. <hi>truſt in the Lord, and do good, ſo ſhalt thou dwell in the Land, and verily thou ſhalt be fed;</hi> to do evil then is not to truſt in God, or have any regard to his providential care.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>When we diſtruſt God when there is no viſible means.</hi> A diſtruſt of God ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders him impotent, or falſe and mutable, or cruel and regardleſs, and what not? We detract from his power, as if it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon creatures, or that he were like an Artificer that could not act with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Tools: As if God were tyed to means, and were beholding to creatures
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:136156:78"/>for his operating power; as if that God who created the World without inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, could not providentially apply himſelf to our particular exigencies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of ſome of his creatures. If he cannot work without this or that means you did expect your mercy by, it ſuppoſeth that God hath made the creature greater than himſelf, and more neceſſary to thy well-being, than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is; or elſe we conceit him falſe or fooliſh, as if he had undertaken a task of government too hard for him, as if he were grown weary of his labour, and muſt have ſome time to recruit his ſtrength; or as if he were unfaithful, not walking by rules of unerring goodneſs; or if we acknowledge him wiſe, and able, and faithful, yet it muſt then be a denyal of his gracious tenderneſs, which is as great as his power and wiſdom, and a perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on equal with any of the reſt. If his care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for us be a principal argument to move us to caſt our care upon him, as it is, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.7. <hi>caſting all your care upon him, for he careth for you:</hi> Then if we caſt not our care upon him, it is a denial of his graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous care of us. This is to imagine him a
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:136156:79"/>tenderer governour of beaſts than men, as though our Saviour had ſpoke a palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble untruth, when he told us, not an hair of our heads doth fall without his leave; as if he regarded Sparrows only, and not his Children; or elſe it implies that God cannot mind us in a crowd of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in ſuch multitudes in the World, which he hath to take care of. But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, as the multitude of things doth not hinder his knowledge of them, ſo neither do they hinder his care. The arms of his goodneſs are as large to embrace all creatures, as the eyes of his Omniſcience are to behold them. From this root do all our fears of the power of men grow, Iſa. 51.12, 13. <hi>who art thou that art afraid of a man that ſhall dye,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and forgetteſt the Lord thy maker, that hath ſtretched forth the heavens?</hi> &amp;c Our forgetfulneſs at leaſt, if not a ſecret denial of God's Power in the works of Creation and Providence, uſhers in diſtruſt of him, and that intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth a fear of man. If <hi>they that know his name, will put their truſt in him,</hi> Pſal: 9.10. <hi>for thou Lord, hast not forſaken them that ſeek thee;</hi> Then a diſtruſt of him diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers an ignorance and inconſideration
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:136156:79"/>of his name and his wayes of working, and implies his forſaking of his creature. He that truſts in any thing elſe beſides God, denies all the powerful operations of God, and conceives him not a ſtrength ſufficient for him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 52.7. That man doth not <hi>make God his ſtrength who truſts in the abundance of his riches.</hi> How groſs is it not to truſt God under the very ſence of his powerful goodneſs, but queſtion whether he can or will do this or that for us? When we will have jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies of him when he doth compaſs us round about with mercy, and encircle us with his beams; 'tis to queſtion whether the Summer-Sun will warm me, though it ſhine directly upon me, and I feel the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor of its beams upon my Body: much more baſe is this, then, to diſtruſt him when we have no means: What doth this imply, but that he cares not what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of his Children; that no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage can be expected from him, that his intentions towards us are not gracious, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven whiles we feel him?</p>

'Tis like a mans picking a pocket, or cutting a throat under the gallows in contempt of Juſtice<note n="*" place="margin">Jenkin.</note>; where as good men are both affected with, and remember God's judgments. <hi>Eber</hi> called his Son <hi>Peleg,</hi> diviſion, becauſe in his daies the Earth was divided; that in the dayly

            <p>'Tis a comfort, That,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Man is a ſpecial object of Providence.</hi> God provides for all creatures, even thoſe that are the works of his hands, much more for a man, who is more pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly the work of his head, in whoſe creation he took Counſel, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.92. <hi>let us make man in our Image, after our likeneſs;</hi> and the work of his heart in being made according to his Image, and intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a ſubordinate end of his whole crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion next to the principal, that of God's glory; he is the preſerver of man and beaſt: of a man principally, of beaſts in ſubſerviency to mans good, and preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Hloy men, a more ſpecial object of it.</hi>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:136156:87"/>God preſerves and provides for all things and all perſons: But his eye is more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly fixed upon thoſe that fear him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.18. <hi>behold, the eye of the lord is upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy;</hi> ſo fixed, as if he had no regard to any thing elſe. If God hath a care of man created after his own Image, though his Image be depraved, much more of thoſe wherein his Image is reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. If God loves himſelf, he loves his Image and his works. A man loves the works which he hath made of ſome exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal matter, much more doth a father love his Son, much more doth God love his own, and therefore will work their good, and diſpoſe of them well. God exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a ſpecial providence over the actions of a good man, as well as his perſon, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.23. <hi>the ſteps of a good man are ordered by the Lord, and he delighteth in his wyas;</hi> 'tis a ſpecial, becauſe a delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful providence, he delights in his way. How highly may it cheer a man to be in covenant, with that God, which rules the world, and hath all things at his beck, to be under not only the care of his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but of his goodneſs? The Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:136156:88"/>of the World, being ſuch an only friend, will do him no hurt, being ſuch an only Father will order all things to his good out of a Fatherly affection; he is the Worlds Soveraign, but a good mans Father: He rules the Heavens and the Earth, but he loves his holy ones. Other things are the objects of his providence, and a good man is the end of it. For <hi>his eyes run to and fro throughout the whole earth to ſhew himſelf ſtrong for him whoſe heart is perfect towards him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Hence it will follow, that the <hi>Spirits of good men have ſufficient grounds to bear up in their innocent ſufferings and ſtorms in the World. Innocent ſufferings;</hi> There is a righteous Governour, who orders all, and will reward them for their pains, as well as their ſervice, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.10. <hi>for God is not unrighteous to forget your work and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of love;</hi> there is one that preſides in the World, who ſees all their calamities, and cannot be miſtaken in their cauſe, who hath as much power and wiſdom, as will to help them. It would be an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction indeed, if there were no ſoveraign power to whom they might make their moan in their diſtreſs, to whom they
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:136156:88"/>might eaſe their conſciences, if there were no Governour to whom they might offer up their petitions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the storms they meet with in the world.</hi> How doth the preſence of a skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Pilot in a weather-beaten Ship cheer the hearts of the fearful Paſſengers? What a dread would it be to them to have the veſſel wherein their lives and all are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, left to the fury of Winds and Waves, without an able hand to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age it? God hath a bridle to check the paſſions of men, to marſhal them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his pleaſure; they are all but his inſtruments in the government, not the Lords of it: God can lay a Plot with more wiſdom for a good mans ſafety, than the Enemy can for his deſtruction; he can countermine their Plots with more power than they can execute them; he can out-wit their craft, over-power their ſtrength, and turn their deſigned cruelty againſt them, as a knife into their own breaſts.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Hence follows a certain ſecurity against a good mans want.</hi> If God take care of the hairs, the ornamental ſuperfluities, why ſhould we doubt his care of our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:136156:89"/>ſupply? If he be the guardian of our hairs which fall off without our ſence of their departure, ſhall he be careleſs of us when we are at a pinch for our all? Will God reach out his care to Beaſts, and deny it to his Children? What would you judge of that Father, who ſhould feed his Servants and ſtarve his Sons? He ſupplies his Enemies, and hath he no bowels for his Frindes? The very unjuſt as well as the juſt are enlightned by his Sun, and refreſht by his rain; and ſhall he not have a providence for thoſe who have a ſpecial intereſt in that Mediator, whoſe interpoſition kept up thoſe ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercies after our forfeiture of them by ſin? If he bleſs with thoſe bleſſings, thoſe who are the objects of his curſe; will he not bleſs thoſe that are in his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial favour with them, ſo far as they may prove bleſſings to them? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.10. <hi>the young Lions do lack and ſuffer hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but they that ſeek the Lord, ſhall not want any good thing, v.</hi> 9. <hi>for there is no want to them that fear him.</hi> A good man ſhall have what he needs, not alwayes what he thinks he needs. Providence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the ſupply of our neceſſities, not of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:136156:89"/>our deſires; he will ſatisfie our wants, but not our wantonneſs. When a thing is not needful, a man cannot properly be ſaid to want it; when it is needful, a good man ſhall not be without it; what is not beſtowed upon us, may not be ſo beautiful at that time wherein we deſire it, for every thing is <hi>beautiful in its ſeaſon</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Eccleſ. <hi>9.11.</hi>
               </note>. He that did not want God's kindneſs to renew him, ſhall never want God's kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſupply him; his hand ſhall not be wanting to give, where his heart hath been ſo large in working. Others live that have an intereſt only in common providence, but good men have provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence cabinetted in a promiſe, and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to them by a deed of covenant-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance; he was a provider before, he hath made himſelf now your Debtor. You might pray for his providential care, before with a common faith, now with a more ſpecial expoſtulation: For in his promiſe he hath given a good man the key of the Cheſt of his providence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is <hi>the promiſe of this life, and that which is to come</hi>

            <p>Again conſider, God doth exerciſe a more ſpecial providence over men, as cloathed with miſerable circumſtances, and therefore among his other Titles, this is one, to be a helper of the Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs<note n="*" place="margin">

'Tis the argument the Church uſed to expreſs her return to God, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.3. <hi>for in thee the fatherleſs find mercy.</hi> Now what greater comfort is there than this, that there is one preſides in the world, who is ſo wiſe, he cannot be miſtaken; ſo faithful he cannot deceive; ſo pitiful he cannot neglect his people; and ſo powerful, that he can make ſtones even to be turned into bread, if he pleaſe?</p>
            <p>Further, take this for a comfortable conſideration,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God doth not govern the World only by his will as an abſolute Monarch, but by his wiſdom and goodneſs at a tender Father.</hi> 'Tis not his greateſt pleaſure to ſhew his Soveraign power, or his unconceivable wiſdom, but his immenſe goodneſs, to which he makes the other attributes ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient. What was God's end in crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, is his end in governing, which was
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:136156:90"/>the communication and diffuſion of his goodneſs; we may be ſure from hence, that God will do nothing but for the beſt, his wiſdom appointing it with the higheſt reaſon, and his goodneſs ordering it to the moſt gracious end; and becauſe he is the higheſt good, he doth not only will good, but the beſt good in every thing he acts.</p>
            <p>What greater comfort can there be, than that we are under the care of an infallible unwearied and righteous Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor? infallible becauſe of his infinite Wiſdom, unwearied becauſe of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible Omnipotency, and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous becauſe of his unbounded Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Holineſs.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The duties ariſing from hence, will run as a thread through the web of our whole lives, and all the motions of them. This Doctrine hath an influence upon our whole courſe; there is nothing we meet with, but is an act of providence; and there is no act of providence, but calls for ſome particular duty. Is there any good we want? we muſt ſeek it at his hands, we muſt depend upon him
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:136156:91"/>for it, we muſt preſcribe no methods to him, but leave the conduct of it to his own wiſdom. Is it a croſs providence, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to our deſires and expectations? Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur not at it. Is it afflictive and troubleſom? Submit to it. Is it either good or bad, and preſent, we muſt ſtudy to underſtand it: is it a good &amp; preſent? give God the glory of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Seek every thing you need at the hands of God.</hi> 'Tis not only the skilfulneſs of the Pilot, but a favourable gale from Heaven, which muſt conduct the Ship to the intended port. As his providence is the foundation, ſo it is the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all prayer. The end of the Lords prayer is, <hi>for thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory:</hi> the providential Kingdom belongs to God, Power he hath to manage it, and his glory is the end of all; ſeek to him therefore for the exerciſe of his power in thy concerns, and for his directing them to his glory in his providential adminiſtrations. Every one of our daies, and both the mercy and the miſery of them, depend upon him, <hi>Pro.</hi> 27.1. <hi>thou knowest not what a day may bring forth.</hi> But God foreſees all events; have recourſe the refore to his care for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

Like the bubbles blown up from a nut-ſhell, eaſily broken by the next puff. Our labour will be as fruitleſs as <hi>Peter</hi>'s with all his toyl, and catch nothing, till God ſpeaks the word, and ſends the fiſh into our net<note n="*" place="margin">

Coloured glaſs can reflect no beams without the Sun's light, nor fruits be ripened without its influence. Our
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:136156:92"/>dependance on God is greater than theirs on the Sun, God lets men play with their own wit and ſtrength, and come to the brink of execution of their deſigns, and then blows upon them, that they may know there is a God in the Earth. <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi> could ſay, it was <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

The reaſon we miſcarry, is becauſe we conſult
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:136156:92"/>not God, but determine without him; and then we have no reaſon to complain of him for not proſpering our way, when we never commended our affairs to his conduct. It hath been the practice of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> firſt petitioned God before he would uſe his intereſt in the Kings favour, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 2.4. <hi>then the King ſaid unto me, for what doſt thou make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt?

'Tis a ridiculous madneſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to do any thing without God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whoſe aſſiſtance and preſerving of us, we had not been able to make that reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Truſt Providence.</hi> To truſt God when our Ware-houſes and Bags are full, and our Tables ſpread, is no hard thing,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:136156:93"/>but to truſt him, when our purſes are empty, but a handful of meal and a cruſe of Oil left, and all ways of relief ſtopt, herein lies the wiſdom of a Chriſtians grace. Yet none are exempted from this duty; all are bound to acknowledg their truſt in him by the dayly prayer for dayly bread; even thoſe that have it in their Cupboards as well as thoſe that want it; The greateſt Prince, as well as the meaneſt beggar. Whatever your wants are, want not faith, and you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not want ſupplies. 'Tis the want of this binds up his hand from doing great works for his Creatures: The more we truſt him, the more he concerns himſelf in our affairs. The more we truſt our ſelves, the more he delights to croſs us; for he hath denounced ſuch an one curſed that maketh Fleſh his arm<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Jor.</hi> 17.5.</note>, though it be the beſt fleſh in the world, becauſe it is a departing from the Lord. No wonder then that God departs from us, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries away his bleſſing with him. While we truſt our ſelves, we do but trouble our ſelves, and know not how to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile our varions reaſons for hopes and fars; but the committing our way to the

God ſometimes leads his people into great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, that they may ſee and acknowledg
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:136156:94"/>his hand in their preſervation. <hi>Daniel</hi> had not had ſo ſignal an experience of Gods care of him, had he been in the lower condition he was in before his new preſerment. God's eye is always up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them that fear him; not to keep di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs from them, but to quicken them in it, and give them as it were a new life from the dead, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.18, 19. <hi>To deliver their Soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine.</hi> God brings us into ſtraits, that we may have more lively experiments of his tenderneſs in his ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable relief: If he be angry, <hi>he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent himſelf for his Servants, when he ſees their power is gone;</hi> becauſe then the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his providence is appropriated to himſelf, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.36, 39. <hi>See now that I, even I am he, and there is no God with me, I kill, and I make alive.</hi> No Creature can have any pretence to ſhare in it; He delights thereby to blow up both our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to him, and admirations of him, and ſtore up in us a treaſure of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to encourage our truſting in him in the like ſtraits. We ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore repoſe our ſelves in God in a deſart, as well as in the Cities; with as much
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:136156:94"/>faith among Savage beaſts, as in the beſt company of the moſt ſociable men<note n="*" place="margin">Durant de Tentat. p. <hi>168.</hi>
               </note>. And anſwer the greateſt ſtrait with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Speech to <hi>Iſaac, God will provide.</hi> For we have to do with a God who is bound up to no means, is at no expence in miraculous ſuccors, who delights to perfect his ſtrength in the Creatures weakneſs. We have to do with a God, who only knows what may further our good, and accordingly orders it; what may hinder it, and therefore prevents it. He can ſet all cauſes in ſuch a poſture, as ſhall conſpire together as one link to bring about ſucceſs, and make even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary motions meet in one gracious end; as the Rivers which run from <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South,</hi> the contrary quarters of the world, agree in the ſurges of one Sea. Though providences may ſeem to croſs one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they ſhall never croſs his word and promiſe, which he hath magnified above all his name. And his Providence is but a ſervant to his Truth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Truſt it in the way of means.</hi> Though we are ſure God hath decreed the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain event of ſuch a thing, yet we muſt not encourage our idleneſs, but our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence.
<pb n="721" facs="tcp:136156:95"/>Though <hi>Moſes</hi> was aſſured of the victory, when <hi>Amalek</hi> came armed againſt him, yet he commands <hi>Joſhua</hi> to draw up the valiant men into a body, himſelf goes to the Mount to pray, and is as diligent in the uſe of all means, as if he had been ignorant of God's purpoſe, and had rather ſuſpected the rout of his own than his Enemies forces. Neither doth <hi>Joſhua</hi> afterwards, though ſecured by promiſe in his conqueſt of <hi>Canaan,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any part of the duty of a wiſe and watchful General, he ſends ſpies, diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plines his forces, beſiegeth Cities, and contrives ſtratagems. Providence directs us by means; not to uſe them, is to tempt our Guardian; where it intends any great thing for our good, it opens a door, and puts ſuch circumſtances into our hands, as we may uſe without the breach of any Command, or the neglect of our own duty.

How preſumptuous would it be for the ſhallow world, a thing worſe than nothing, and vanity, to preſcribe rules to the Creator? Much more for a ſingle perſon, a little Atom of duſt, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely worſe than nothing, and vanity, to do it. Since we had no hand in Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the world or our ſelves, let us not preſume to direct God in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, <hi>Job</hi> 38.4. <hi>Where waſt thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare if thou haſt understanding?</hi> Would it not be a diſparagement to God to ſtoop to thy fooliſh deſires, yea? would you not your ſelves have a lower conceit of him, if he ſhould degrade his wiſdom to the wrong biaſs of your blind reaſon?</p>

We muſt walk by the rule of reaſon which God hath placed in us for our guide; yet if Providence brings to paſs any other event contrary to our rational expectations, becauſe it is a clear evidence of his will, we muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce. As when a Traveller hath two wayes to come to his journeys end, the one ſafe, the other dangerous, reaſon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades him to chuſe the ſafeſt way, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he falls among thieves; now having uſed his reaſon, which in that caſe was to be his director, he muſt acquieſce: God's Providence bringeth forth an event, which he could not without violence to his reaſon avoid. And therefore it is a great vanity, when a man hath reſolved the moſt probable way in a buſineſs, and fails in it, to torment himſelf; becauſe though our conſultations depended upon our ſelves, yet the iſſues of them are ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the hand of God. It concerns us
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:136156:98"/>therefore to ſubmit to Gods diſpoſal of us and our affairs, ſince nothing can come to paſs but by the will of God effecting it, or permitting it. If the fall of a Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row is not without his Will<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.29.</note>, much leſs can the greater events which befall men the nobler Creatures, be without the ſame concurrence of Gods pleaſure; therefore ſubmit. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Whatſoever God doth, he doth wiſely.</hi> His acts are not ſudden and raſh, but acts of Counſel; not taken up upon the preſent poſture of things, but the reſolves of Eternity. As he is the higheſt wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſo all his acts reliſh of it, and he guides his will by Counſel, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.11. <hi>Who worketh all things after the counſel of his own will.</hi>} If God took Counſel in Creating the World, much more in lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a platform of government, much more in the act of government; for men can frame models of government, that can never reduce them into practice. Now God being infinitely wiſe, and his will infinitely good, it muſt needs be that goodneſs and wiſdom are the rules where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he directs himſelf in his actions in the world. And what greater motive can
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:136156:98"/>there be to perſwade our ſubmiſſion, than Wiſdom and Goodneſs tranſacting all things? Gods counſel being the firmeſt, as well as the wiſeſt, it is a folly both ways to reſiſt it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>God diſcovers his mind to us by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences.</hi> Every work of God being the reſult of his Counſel, when we ſee it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually brought forth into the World, what elſe doth it diſcover to us, but that Counſel and Will of his? Every ſingle providence hath a language wherein Gods mind is ſignified, much more a train and contexture of them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.22. <hi>tell John what things you have ſeen and heard, how that the blend ſee, the lame walk, the leapers are cleanſed, the deaf hear, the dead are raiſed to life, to the poor the goſpel is preached.</hi> Our Saviour informs <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples from acts of providence; he gives him no other anſwer, but turns him over to interpret and conſtrue his works in the caſe. Providence therefore muſt not be reſiſted, when Gods mind in it is diſcovered: 'Tis diſingenuous to act a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his pleaſure and manifeſt mind; 'tis the Devils ſin. <hi>Aaron</hi> when he loſt his two Sons, in ſo judicial a manner by

            <p n="4">4. <hi>Murmur not at providence.</hi> Though we do not clearly reſiſt it, if there be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining ſubmiſſion, it is a partial oppoſition to the Will of God. We might as well murmur at God's creation, as at his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, for that is as arbitrary as this; he is under no Law but his own righteous will: we ſhould therefore leave the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the world to God's wiſdom, as we acknowledge the frame of it to be an act of his power. If God ſhould man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age his wayes according to our preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, what ſatisfction would God have, what ſatisfaction would the world have? He might be unjuſt to himſelf, and unjuſt to others. Your own complaints would
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:136156:99"/>not be ſtilled, when you ſhould feel the ſmart of your own Counſels; yet if they were, what ſatisfaction could there be to the complaints of others, whoſe intereſts and therefore judgments and deſires lye croſs to yours? Man is a croſs Creature. The <hi>Iſarelites</hi> exclaimed to God againſt <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> and when the Scene was chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they did no leſs murmur againſt <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> in the wilderneſs. They were as trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom when they were delivered, as when they were afflicted. In <hi>Egypt</hi> they would have their liberty, and in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs their ſtomachs turn, and they long for the Onyons and Garlick, though attended with their former ſlavery. Let God govern the World according to his own Wiſdom and Will, till all mankind can agree in one method to offer to him, and that I think will never be, though the world ſhould laſt fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Murmur not therefore; whatſoever is done in the world, is the work of a wiſe agent, who acts for the perfection of the whole univerſe; and why ſhould I murmur at that which promotes the common happineſs and perfection, that being better and more deſirable, than
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:136156:100"/>the perfection of any one particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? Muſt a Lutiniſt break all his ſtrings, becauſe one is out of tune? And muſt God change his courſe, becauſe things are out of order with one man, though in regard of divine providence things are not out of order in themſelves, or without any care, for God is a God of order? This temper will hinder our prayers; With what face can we pray to that God whoſe wiſdom we thus repine at? If God doth exerciſe a providence in the World, why do we murmur? if he doth not take care of thoſe things, why do we pray to him? 'tis a contradiction. It alſo hinders us from giving God the glory, and our ſelves the comfortable ſight of his providence. God may have taken ſomething from us, which is the matter of our ſorrow, and given ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing to us, which might be the matter of our joy. <hi>Jacob</hi> loſt a joint, and got a bleſſing<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 32.29, 31.</note>: What advantage can it be to murmur? Can all your cryes ſtop the motions of the Heavens, when a ſtorm reaches you? Can your clamours make the Clouds move the faſter, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the ſhowers from drenching us?
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:136156:100"/>Murmuring at any afflictive providence, is the way to make the Rod ſmarter in it ſelf, and ſharper to us.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Study providence.</hi> 'Tis a part of <hi>Atheiſm</hi> not to think the acts of God in the World worth our ſerious thoughts. And if you would know the meaning of his adminiſtrations, grow up in the fear of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.14. <hi>The ſecret of the Lord is with them that fear him.</hi> God is highly angry with thoſe that mind him not, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 28.5. <hi>becauſe they regard not the operation of his hands, he ſhall deſtroy them, and not build them up:</hi> He ſhall utterly root them out.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Study providence univerſally.</hi> The <hi>darkeſt;</hi> God brings order out of the Worlds confuſion, even as he framed a beautiful Heaven and Earth out of a rude Maſs. The <hi>terriblest;</hi> theſe offer ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth our obſervation; the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful providence of God makes <hi>Sodom</hi> an example to after ages. <hi>Jude</hi> 7. <hi>They are ſet forth for an example, ſuffering the venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of eternal fire,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>ſmallest;</hi> God is a wiſe agent, and ſo the leaſt of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are ſignificant. There is nothing ſuperfluous in thoſe acts, we account the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:136156:101"/>meaneſt; or to act vainly and lightly, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues imperfection, which cannot be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to God. The wiſdom of God may be much ſeen in thoſe providences the blind World counts ſmall; as a little picture is oft times of more value, and hath more of the workman's skill than a larger which an ignorant perſon might prize at a higher rate; the Lilies, Flowers, Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, our Saviour raiſes excellent obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations from.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Regularly.</hi> By the <hi>Word;</hi> compare providence and the promiſe together. God's manner of adminiſtrations, and the meaning of them, is underſtood by the word, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.13. <hi>Thy way, O God, is in the Sanctuary.</hi> By <hi>Faith;</hi> we many times correct our ſence by reaſon, when we look through a blew or green glaſs, and ſee all things blew or green; though our ſenſe repreſents them ſo, yet our reaſon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers the miſtake; Why ſhould we not correct reaſon by faith? Indeed our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blind reaſon ſtands in as much need of a regulation by faith, as our deceitful ſence doth of a regulation by reaſon. We may often obſerve in the Goſpel, that the holy Cheſt taking notice of the particular cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:136156:101"/>in the bringing Chriſt into the World, and in the courſe of his life, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten hath thoſe expreſſions, <hi>as it was written; that the Scriptures might be fulfilled.</hi> There is not a providence happens in the World, but there are ſome general rules in the World, whereby we may apprehend the meaning of it. From God's former work diſcovered in his word, we may trace his preſent foot-ſteps: Obſerve the timings of providence wherein the beauty of it appears, ſince <hi>God hath made every thing beautiful in its time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Intirely.</hi> View them in their <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion.</hi> A harſh touch ſingle would not be pleaſing, but may rarely affect in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort: The providences of God bear a juſt proportion to one another, and are beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful in their intire Scheme; but when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded apart, we ſhall come far ſhort of a delightful underſtanding of them. As in a piece of Arras folded up, and afterwards particularly opened, we ſee the hand or foot of a man, the branch of a tree, or if we look on the outſide, we ſee nothing but knots and threads, and uncouth ſhapes that we know not what to make of; but when it is fully opened, and we have the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:136156:102"/>whole Web before us, we ſee what Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories and pleaſing characters are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven in it. View them in their end; there is no true judgment to be made of a thing in motion, unleſs we have a right proſpect of the end to which it tends. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things which may ſeem terrible in their motion, may be excellent in their end. Providence is crowned by the end of it. <hi>Aſaph</hi> was much troubled about the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity of the wicked, and affliction of the Godly, but he was well ſatisfied when he underſtood their end, which was the end of Providence too, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.16, 17. <hi>When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me, until I went into the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, then underſtood I their end. Moſes</hi> his Rod was a Serpent in its motion upon the ground; but when taken up, it was a Rod again to work miracles. God ſet us a pattern for this in the Creation. He views the Creatures as they came into being, and pronounced them <hi>good;</hi> he takes a review of them afterward in their whole frame, and the ſubordination of them to one another, and the ends he had deſtined them to, and then pronounceth them <hi>very good.</hi> The merciful provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:136156:102"/>of God if ſingly looked upon, will appear good, but if reviewed in the whole web, and the end of them, will commence very good in our apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Calmly.</hi> Take heed of paſſion in this ſtudy; that is a miſt before the eye of the mind. Senſual pleaſures alſo diſturb and ſtifle the noble operations of the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective part, and all improving thoughts of Gods providence, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.12. <hi>And the harp and the viol and wine are in their feaſts, but they regard not the work of the Lord, nor conſider the operations of his bands;</hi> All thoughts of them are choak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the pleaſures of ſenſe. Paſſions and ſenſual pleaſures are like flying clouds in the night, interpoſing themſelves between the ſtars and our eyes, that we cannot obſerve the motions of them. Turbulent paſſions or Swiniſh pleaſures prevailing, obſcure the providence of God. Our own humour and intereſt we often make the meaſures of our judgment of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: <hi>Shimei</hi> when <hi>Abſalom</hi> rebels againſt his father, looks no further than his own intereſt, and therefore interprets it as a judgment of God in revenging the houſe
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:136156:103"/>of <hi>Saul,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.7, 8. <hi>The Lord hath returned upon thee all the blood of the houſe of Saul, in whoſe ſtead thou hast reigned.</hi> Therefore the Spirit of God takes parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular notice that he was of the houſe of <hi>Saul, v.</hi> 5. when indeed this judgment was quite another thing, for <hi>David</hi>'s ſin in the matter of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> was written in the forehead of it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Seriouſly.</hi> 'Tis not an eaſie work; for the cauſes of things are hid as the ſeminal virtues in plaints, not viſible till they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt themſelves. Providence is God's Lanthorn in many affairs, if we do not follow it cloſe, we may be left in the dark, and loſe our way. With much Prayer; For we cannot of our ſelves find out the reaſon of them; being ſhallow Creatures, we cannot find out thoſe infinite wiſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods God obſerves in the managing of them; but if we ſeriouſly ſet to work, and ſeek God in it, God may inform us, and make them intelligible to us. Though a man may not be able of himſelf to find out the frame and motions of an Engine, yet when the Artificer hath explained the work, diſcovered the intent of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick, it may be eaſily underſtood. If it
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:136156:103"/>be dark, whilſt you ſeriouſly muſe on it, God may ſend forth a light into you, and give you an underſtanding of it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2.20. <hi>Joſeph thought</hi> of thoſe things, and whilſt he thought on them, <hi>the Angel of the Lord appeared to him</hi> in a dream; God made them known to him. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſaw God's acts in the bulk of them, but <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaw his way and the manner how he wrought them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.7. <hi>He made known his wayes unto Moſes, his acts unto the Children of Iſrael. Moſes</hi> had more converſe with God than they, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was admitted in to his ſecrets.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Holily.</hi> With a deſign to conform to that duty providence calls for. Our motions ſhould be according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences of God, when we underſtand the intent of them. There is a call of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22.12. <hi>In that day the Lord called to weeping and mourning;</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to ſorrow, ſometimes to joy. If it be a providence to diſcover our ſin, let us comply with it by humiliation; if it be to further our grace, ſuit it by lively and freſh actings. As the ſap in plants deſcends with the Sun's declination, and aſcends at the return of the Sun from the Tropick;
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:136156:104"/>there are ſeveral graces to be exerciſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſeveral acts of providence; either pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick to the Church and Nation, or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular to our own perſons. Sometimes faith, ſometimes joy, ſometimes patience, ſometimes ſorrow for ſin. There are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual leſſons in every providence; for it doth not only offer ſomething to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, but ſomething to be practiſed, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.15. A Child is brought to Chriſt, and Chriſt from thence teaches them a leſſon of humility. <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.1, 2, 3. When Chriſt diſcourſes of that ſad provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the blood of the <hi>Galileans,</hi> and the Tower of <hi>Siloa,</hi> he puts them upon the exerciſe of repentance. The Ruler en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the time when his Son began to recover, that his faith in Chriſt might be confirmed, for upon that circumſtance it did much hang; and in doubtful caſes after a ſerious ſtudy of it, and thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not which way to determine, conſider what makes moſt for God's glory and thy ſpiritual good, for that is the end of all. Let us therefore ſtudy providence; not as Children do Hiſtories, to know what men were in the World, or to pleaſe their fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy only; but as wiſe men, to underſtand
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:136156:104"/>the motions of States, and the intrigues of Counſels; to enrich them with a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge whereby they may be ſerviceable to their Countrey. So let us enquire into the Providence of God to underſtand the mind of God, the intereſt of the Church, the wiſdom and kindneſs of God and our own duty in comormity thereunto.</p>

               <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. <hi>All the motions of providence in the World are ultimately for the good of the Church; of thoſe whoſe heart is perfect to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him.</hi> Providence follows the rule of Scripture. Whatſoever was written, was written for the Churches comfort<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4.</note>. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is acted in order to any thing writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, is acted for the Churches good. All the providences of God in the World are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to his declarations in his word. All former providences were ultimately in order to the bringing a Mediator into the World, and for the glory of him; then
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:136156:105"/>ſurely all the providences of God ſhall be in order to the perfecting the glory of Chriſt in that myſtical body, whereof Chriſt is head, and wherein his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and his Glory are ſo much concerned. See the Proof of this by a Scripture or two. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.10. <hi>All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth unto ſuch as keep his Covenant and his Teſtimonies.</hi> Not one path, but <hi>[all]</hi> the works and motions; not one particular act or paſſage of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, but the whole tract of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings; not only thoſe which are more ſmooth and pleaſant, but thoſe which are more rugged and bitter. All <hi>[mercy and truth]</hi> ſutable to that affection he bears in his heart to them, and ſutable to the declaration of that affection he hath made in his promiſe. There is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture and a friendly connexion of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and faithfulneſs in every one of them. They both kiſs and embrace each other in every motion of God towards them. As mercy made the Covenant, ſo truth ſhall perform it And there ſhall be as much mercy as truth in all Gods actings towards thoſe that that keep it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8 28.

               <hi>We know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpoſe;</hi> [<hi>we know,</hi> we do not conjecture or gueſs ſo, but we have an infallible aſſurance of it. <hi>[All things]</hi> even the moſt frightful, and ſo thoſe that have in reſpect of ſenſe, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Gall and Wormwood in them; <hi>[work together]</hi> they all conſpire with an admirable harmony and unanimous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent for a Chriſtian's good. One particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar act may ſeem to work to the harm of the Church, as one particular act may work to the good of wicked men: but the whole ſeries and frame of things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine together for the good of thoſe that are affectionate to him. Both the Lance that makes us bleed, and the plaiſter which refreſheth the Wounds. Both the griping purges and the warming Cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als combine together for the Patients cure <hi>[to them who are called according to his purpoſe.]</hi> Here the Apoſtle renders a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this poſition; becauſe they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not only in the general amongſt the reſt of the world, to whom the Goſpel comes; but they are ſuch that were in
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:136156:106"/>Gods purpoſe and counſel from Eternity to ſave, and therefore reſolved to encline their will to Faith in Chriſt. Therefore all his other Counſels about the affairs of the world ſhall be for their good. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon of this, the Apoſtle intimates <hi>verſ.</hi> 27. <hi>The ſpirit makes interceſſion for the ſaints according to the will of God.</hi> The interceſſions of the Spirit which are alſo according to Gods will and purpoſe, will not be fruitleſs in the main end, which both the interceſſions of the Spirit and purpoſe of God, and the will and deſires of the Saints do aim at, which is their good. Indeed where any is the object of this grand purpoſe of God, he is the object of God's infinite and innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable thoughts, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.5. <hi>Many, O Lord my God, are thy wonderful works which thou haſt done, and thy thoughts which are to us<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee; if I would declare and ſpeak of them, they are more than can be numbred.</hi> The Pſalmiſt ſeems to intimate that in all the wonderful works which God hath done, his thoughts are toward his people. He thinks of them in all his actions; and
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:136156:107"/>thoſe thoughts are infinite, and cannot be numbred, and reckoned up by any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. He ſeems to reſtrain the thoughts of God to his people in all thoſe works of wonder which he doth in the World, and which others are the Subjects of: But his thoughts or purpoſes and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in all <hi>(for the word ſignifies purpoſes too)</hi> are chiefly, next to his own glory, directed toward his people, thoſe that truſt in him, which <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. he had pronounced bleſſed. They run in his mind as if his heart was ſet upon them, and none but them.</p>
            <p>Here I ſhall premiſe two things as the ground-work of what follows.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>God certainly in all his actions has ſome end;</hi> that is without queſtion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is a wiſe agent; to act vainly and lightly is an evidence of imperfection, which cannot be aſcribed to the only wiſe God. The Wheels of Providence are full of Eyes<note n="*" place="margin">Ezek. 1.18.</note>. There is motion, and a knowledge of the end of that motion. And Jeſus Chriſt, who is Gods Deputy in the providential government, hath Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Eyes, as well as Seven Horns<note n="*" place="margin">Revel. 5.6.</note> a perfect ſtrength, and a perfect knowledg
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:136156:107"/>how to uſe that ſtrength, and to what end to uſe it. Seven being the number of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in Scripture.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That certainly is Gods end which his heart is moſt ſet upon, and that which is laſt in execution.</hi> What doth God do at the folding up of the World, but perfect his people, and welcome them into Glory? Therefore God principally next to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, loves his Church. The whole Earth is his, but the Church is his treaſure, <hi>Ex.</hi> 19.5. <hi>If you will keep my Covenant, then ſhall you be a peculiar treaſure unto me above all people, for all the Earth is mine; Segullah</hi> ſuch a treaſure, that a Man, a King will intruſt in no hands but his own; <hi>all the Earth is mine,</hi> is not a reaſon why the Church was his treaſure, but an incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of thankfulneſs, that when the whole Earth was his, and lay before him, and there were many people that he might have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen and loved before them, yet he pitched upon them to make them his choiceſt treaſure. And when the bleſſed God hath pitched upon a people, and made them his treaſure, what he doth for them, is with his whole heart, and with his whole Soul, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32 41, 42. ſpeaking of making an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:136156:108"/>Covenant, he adds, <hi>yea I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce over them to do them good,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly with my whole heart, and with my whole Soul:</hi> As though God minded no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but thoſe people he had made an everlaſting Covenant with; which is the higheſt ſecurity, and moſt pregnant expreſſion of his affection that can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to any, not to give them a parcel or moiety of his heart, but the whole infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite intire piece, and to engage it all with the greateſt delight in doing good to them. That infinite heart of God, and all the contrivances and workings of it, center in the Churches welfare. The World is a Wilderneſs, but the Church is a Garden. If he water the Wilderneſs, will he not much more dreſs his Garden? If the flights of Birds be obſerved by him, ſhall not alſo the particular concernments of the Church?

<pb n="200" facs="tcp:136156:109"/>wickedneſs of it before this time, but he overlooked it all, and had reſpect to the times of Chriſt, and the publiſhing faith in him, and repentance, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.30. <hi>And the times of this ignorance God winked at,</hi> God overlooked<note n="*" place="margin">

                  </gap>
               </note>; he looked not ſo upon them, as to be provoked to deſtroy the world; but his eyes were fixed on the times of Chriſtianity; therefore would not take notice in the extremity of his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the wickedneſs of thoſe forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ages. Believers are the Salt of the Earth<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.13.</note>, which makes the World ſavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to God, and keeps it from corrupting. 'Tis meant not only of the Apoſtles, but of Chriſts Diſciples, of all Chriſtians; for to them was that Sermon made, <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>If the Salt have loſt his ſavour,</hi> if the Salt be corrupted, and Chriſtianity over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown in the World, wherewith ſhall the World be ſalted? how can it be kept from corruption? If they that perſecuted the Prophets before you in <hi>Judea,</hi> (which is ſometimes called the Earth in Scripture) cannot reliſh you, and find nothing grateful to their Palates in your Doctrine and Converſation, wherewith ſhall they be ſalted? How ſhall they be preſerved
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:136156:109"/>from corruption? The Land will be good for nothing but to be given as a prey to the <hi>Romans</hi> to be trod under their feet, as being caſt out of Gods protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. They are the foundation of the world, <hi>Pro.</hi> 10.25. <hi>the righteous are an everlaſting foundation. Maimonides</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands it thus, that the World ſtands for the righteous ſakes. When God had <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> and his Family lodged in the Ark, he cares not what deluge and deſtruction he brings upon the reſt of the World. When he had conducted <hi>Lot</hi> out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> he brings down that dreadful ſtorm of fire. He cares for no place,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Grotius</hi> on the place.</note> no nor for the whole World any longer than whilſt his people are there, or he hath ſome to bring in, in time. For the meaneſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever is of more worth than a world; therefore when God hath gathered all together, he will ſet fire upon this frame of the Creation: For what was the end of Chriſts coming and dying, but to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all things together in one? <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.10. <hi>That in the diſpenſation of the fulneſs of time he might gather together in one all things in Chriſt.</hi> When Chriſt hath ſummed up all together, he hath attained his end.
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:136156:110"/>And to what purpoſe then can we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine God ſhould continue the World a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny longer? for his delight is not ſimply in the World, but in the Saints there. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.3. <hi>But to the Saints that are in the Earth, in whom is all my delight,</hi> not in the Earth, but in the Saints there, which are the only excellent things in it, which Chriſt ſpeaks (of whom that Pſalm is meant) who knew well what was the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his Fathers pleaſure. The ſweet ſavour God ſmelt in <hi>Noah</hi>'s ſacrifice, was the occaſion of God's declaration for the Worlds ſtanding, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.21. <hi>and the Lord ſaid in his heart, I will not curſe the ground any more for mans ſake.</hi> That he would no more ſmite it with a totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying judgment. It was his reſpect to Chriſt repreſented in that ſacrifice, and to the faith and grace of <hi>Noah</hi> the ſacrificer. What Savour could an infinitely pure ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſmell in the blood and flames of beaſts?</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The courſe of natural things is for the good of the Church, or particular mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of it.</hi> God makes articles of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement with the Beaſts and Fowls, whoſe nature is raging and rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, and binds them in ſure bonds for
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:136156:110"/>the performance of thoſe articles, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 2.18. <hi>And in that day will I make a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for them with the beaſts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground, and will make them to lye down ſafely.</hi> As upon our ſin God can arm them againſt us; ſo upon our obedience he can make them ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable even againſt their natures; as if he had made a Covenant with them, and they had both the reaſon and virtue to obſerve it. I do not remember any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in Scripture, that God went out of the uſual tract of his providence, and act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in an extraordinary manner, but where his people were one way or other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. It was for <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s and the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> ſake that the Sun was arreſted to ſtand ſtill in the Valley of <hi>Ajalon,</hi> that they might have light enough to defeat their Enemies, and purſue their victory<note n="*" place="margin">

God hath nor a diſpleaſure with ſenſleſs Creatures, neither is tranſported with ſtrains of ſury againſt ſuch objects, when he alters their natural courſe. <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Was the Lord diſpleaſed againſt the Rivers, was thy wrath againſt the Sea, that thou didſt ride upon thy Horſes, and Chariots of Salvation?</hi> No, but he made thoſe Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures the Horſes and Chariots to ſpeed aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance and ſalvation to his people, which the Pſalmiſt elegantly deſcribes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 114. All Creatures are his Hoſt, and that God that created them, hath ſtill the Soveraign command over them, and can imbody them in an Army to ſerve his purpoſe for the deliverance of his people,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:136156:111"/>as he did againſt <hi>Pharaoh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The intereſt of Nations is ordered as is moſt for the Churches good</hi> He orders both the courſe of natural things, and of civil affairs, for their intereſt. He alters the ſtate of things, and changeth Governours and Governments for the ſake of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. For theſe cauſes God ſent <hi>Eliſha</hi> to Crown <hi>Jehu</hi> King, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 9.6, 7. <hi>I have anointed thee King over the people of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that I may avenge the blood of my Servants the Prophets, and the blood of all the ſervants of the Lord at the hand of Jezabel.</hi> For the ſakes of the Godly in that Nation, and the revenging the blood of the Prophets which had been ſhed, was he raiſed up by the Lord.

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:136156:112"/>ſits still, and is at reſt;</hi> there had been Wars in <hi>Artaxarexes</hi> and <hi>Xerxes</hi> his time, but in the time of <hi>Darius,</hi> that part of the World had an univerſal peace, which was the fitteſt time for the reſtoration of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and building the Temple; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it could not be built, but by the Kings coſt, whoſe treaſure in the time of War was expended another way; nor would it conſiſt with their policy to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the <hi>Jews</hi> to their government at ſuch a time when they had Wars with the Neighbour parts of <hi>Egypt.</hi> See how God orders the ſtate of the World in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviency to his gracious intentions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Church. The time of the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> captivity was now out according to the promiſe of God, and God gives that part of the World a general peace, that the reſtauration of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>building of the Temple might be facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, and the truth of his promiſe in their deliverance accompliſhed. Upon the news of this general peace in that part of the World, Chriſt expoſtulates with God for the reſtauration of <hi>Jeruſalem, verſ.</hi> 12. <hi>How long, O Lord, wilt thou not have mercy on Jeruſalem, and on the cities of Judeah,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:136156:112"/>againſt which thou hast had indignation theſe threeſcore and ten years?</hi> The time of the Captivity determined by God, was now expired. The firſt reformation in <hi>Germany</hi> was back'd by reaſon of ſtate as it was then ordered; it being the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of many Princes of that Countrey to countenance <hi>Luther</hi>'s Doctrine, for the putting a ſtop to the growing greatneſs of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, who had evident de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns to enſlave them. I might mention many more; only by the way let me ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe thoſe that have an inclination to read hiſtories of former tranſactions, to which men naturally are addicted, to make this your end, to obſerve the ſtrange provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of God in the World, and how admirably he hath made them ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to the intereſt of the Church; which will be the moſt profitable way of read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, whereby they will not only ſatisfie your curioſity, but eſtabliſh your Chriſtianity. <hi>Calvin</hi> underſtands that place, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.8. <hi>He ſets the bounds of the people according to the number of the Children of Iſrael,</hi> that in the whole or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of the ſtate of the World, God propoſeth this as his end to conſult for

Therefore God ſets the people bounds, or enlargeth them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they may be ſerviceable one way or other to this end. And the reaſon is rendred, <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>For the Lords portion is his people, and Iacob is the lot of his inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance.</hi> Therefore God orders all the reſt of the World in ſubſerviency to the maintaining and improving his portion and inheritance.</p>

And the beſtowing ſuch giſts upon men, is none of the meaneſt argument for Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential government of the World. As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The gifts of good men.</hi> The gifts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon <hi>Paul</hi> were depoſited in him
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:136156:113"/>not only to be poſſeſſed by him, but uſed and laid out for the good of the Church, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.25. <hi>Whereof I am made a Miniſter according to the diſpenſation of God which is given to me for you:</hi> The manifeſtation of the Spirit to any man is given to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit withal, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7.

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The giſts and common graces of bad men.</hi> There is ſomething that is amiable in men, though they have not grace. As in Stones, Plants and Flowers, though they have not ſenſe, there is ſomething grateful in them, as colour and ſmell, &amp;c. And all thoſe things that are lovely in men, are for the Churches good, the beſt life, and the worſt death, things preſent, let who will be the poſſeſſor, all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Life and Death are for the good of Believers, becauſe they are Chriſts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22. <hi>Whether Paul, or Apollo, or Cephas, or the world, i.e.</hi> [Whether the gifts of the prime lights in the Church, or the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon gifts of the world] <hi>are all yours, and
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:136156:114"/>ye are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods.</hi> God is the diſpencer of them, Chriſt is the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of them, and all for your ſakes. As the medicinable qualities of waters are not for the good of themſelves, but the accommodation of the indigencies of men. By the common works of the Spirit God doth keep his children from ſuffering much evil in the World. For it cannot be ſuppoſed, that the Spirit, whoſe miſſion is principally for the Church, ſhould give ſuch gifts out of love to men which hate him, and are not the objects of his eternal purpoſe; but he hath ſome other ends indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, which is the advantage of his Church and people: and this God cauſes by the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpel, which when it works gracious works in ſome, produceth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon works in others for the good of thoſe gracious ones. As a ſeed of corn hath ſtraw, husks, and chaff come up with it, which are ſhelters to that little ſeed which lies in the midſt; ſo in the preaching of the Goſpel there are ſome husks come up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong natural men, which God makes to be ſhelters to the Church as thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon works, and reſtraining men through the knowledge of Chriſt. God gives
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:136156:114"/>gifts to them, not out of love to them, but love to his Church. As Nurſes of great mens Children are fed with better meat than the other Servants, not out of any particular perſonal reſpect to them, but to their office, that the milk whereby the child is nouriſhed, may be the ſweeter and wholeſomer; were it not for that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, ſhe muſt be content with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et allowed to the reſt of the Servants. Some ſtinking plants may have medicinal virtues which the Phyſician extracts for the cure of a diſeaſe, and flings the reſt upon the Dunghil. God beſtows ſuch qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities upon men otherwiſe unſavoury to him, which he draws forth upon ſeveral occaſions for the good of thoſe that are more peculiarly under his care, and then caſts them away. Theſe gifts are indeed the ruin of bad men, becauſe of their pride, but the Churches advantage in regard of their excellency, and are often as profitable to others, as dangerous to themſelves. As all that good which is in plants and animals is for the good of man; ſo all the gifts of natural men are for the Churches good, for they are for that end as the principal next the glory
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:136156:115"/>of God, becauſe every inferior thing is ordained to ſomething ſuperior as its end. Plants are ordained for the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment of Beaſts, and both Plants and Beaſts for Men. The inferior men for the ſervice of higher, and all for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity; yet ſtill there is a higher end be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond thoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the glory of God, to which they are ultimately ordained, which is ſo connected with the Churches good, that what ſerves one, ſerves the other.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Angels,</hi> the top Creatures in the Creation, are ordered for the good of the Church. If the Stars are not Cyphers in the World only to be gaz'd upon, but have their influences both upon Plants and Animals; As the Sun in impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating the Earth, and enlivening the Plants, and aſſiſting the growth of fruits for the good of mankind: If the ſtars have thoſe natural influences upon the ſenſible world, the Angels which are the morning-ſtars, have no leſs intereſt as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments in the government of it. The Heathens had ſuch a notion of <hi>Daemons</hi> working thoſe things which were done in the world, but according to the will
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:136156:115"/>and order of the ſupream God. The Angels are called Watchers, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.13. <hi>a Watcher and an holy one, verſ.</hi> 17. <hi>this is by the decree of the watchers, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand by the word of the holy ones:</hi> they watch for Gods orders, and watch for Gods honour, and the Churches good.

               <hi>approbative</hi> as they ſubcribe to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and goodneſs of it. As the Saints are ſaid to judge the world not <hi>authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative</hi> as in commiſſion with Chriſt, but as they approve of Chriſts ſentence. They ſeem to requeſt thoſe things of God which may make for his glory, and they decree among themſelves what is fit to be preſented to God in order to his glory. They cannot endure that men ſhould trample upon Gods authority, deſpoil him of his right, and tread down his inheritance; and therefore they ſend ſuch requeſts to God to act ſo as men may acknowledg him and his govenment, <hi>to the intent that the living may know that the moſt high rules in the kingdoms of men.</hi> Their care therefore muſt be for the

            <p n="5">5. <hi>Perſecutions.</hi> Theſe naturally tend to the diſſolution and utter extirpation of it, but God orders them otherwiſe. God doth often lay the Scene of his ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:136156:130"/>providences in very diſmal afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: As the Limner firſt puts on the dusky colours, on which he intends to draw the portraiture of ſome illuſtrious beauty. The Oppreſſion of <hi>Iſrael</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before their Deliverance, was the dusky colour whereupon God drew thoſe gracious lines of their Salvation from <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> the pattern of all the after Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of the Church in all Ages, and a Type of our Spiritual Redemption by Chriſt. The Humiliation, Perſecution and Death of the Son of God, was the dusky colour upon which God drew that amazing piece of Divine Love and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in mans ſalvation, which the eyes of Saints and Angels will be fix'd on with raviſhing admirations to all Eternity. All Afflictions in the World, which God doth exerciſe the Church with, are parts of his Providence, and like mournful Notes in Muſick, which make the melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Tune more pleaſant, and ſet off thoſe ſweeter Aires which follow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. Afflictions here, cauſe the joys of Heaven to appear more glorious in the eyes of glorified Saints. The Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions of the Martyrs did but highten
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:136156:131"/>their Graces, ſend them to the place of Reſt, and enlarge their Robes of Glory. God many times ſaves his People by ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and brings them to the ſhore up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the planks of a broken ſhip, and makes that which was the occaſion of their loſs, to be a means of their ſafety: they ſometimes evidence that which they would deſtroy. <hi>Herods</hi> Murdering the Children to deſtroy him that was born King of the <hi>Jews,</hi> made his Birth more Conſpicuous in the World: Snuffing the Candle makes it burn the clearer.</p>

And indeed it was remarkably for their good; for they who before were addicted to Idolatry, were never guilty of the ſame ſin after: And God kept them from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drawn away to it by the example and ſolicitation of thoſe among whom they were. The Church grows by tears, and withers by ſmiles. Gods Vine thrives the better for pruning. God makes our Perſecutions fit us for that for which we are perſecuted.

And Chriſt himſelf ſtands more aſtoniſhed, and wondring at the Faith of the Centurian, the importunity of the <hi>Canaanitiſh</hi> Woman; condeſcends to them to grant them what they would have. You never find him taking notice of the Learning of the Rabbies, the Magnificence of <hi>Herod,</hi> or the glorious Building of the Temple.

And this Miracle was in order to the Churches Deliverance from a preſent oppreſſive Enemy. Certainly when we find God taking care, and ordering even the very Pins, Snuffers and Baſins of the Temple, the place of his Worſhip, as well as the more ſtately Ornaments of it; we may ſay, doth his Care extend to the meaneſt Utenſils in his Temple, and not much more to the Worſhippers in it? Doth he give order for the Candleſticks,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:136156:136"/>and will he not have much more care of the lights in them? His care to the leaſt, implies his care of the greateſt too.

And you know the ſtory, how God regulated himſelf by <hi>Abraham</hi>'s prayer, and denyed him nothing, till <hi>Abraham</hi> left off ſuing any more. It would make one conjecture, that if <hi>Abraham</hi> had proceeded farther, he had quite diverted the judgment from <hi>Sodom.</hi> And when the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked God by a Golden Calf, he would not do any thing againſt them, till he had conſulted <hi>Moſes,</hi> and therefore layes the whole caſe before him, and ſeeks to take him off from pleading with the Lord, and promiſing to make of him a great Nation<note n="*" place="margin">Exod. <hi>32.9, 10.</hi> and the Lord ſaid to Moſes, I have ſeen this people, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it is a ſtiff-necked people, now ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let me alone that my wrath may wax hot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them.</note>, and in ſuch terms, that one would won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at. <hi>Now therefore let me alone.</hi> As if God did fear <hi>Moſes</hi>'s interpoſition would prevent him and diſſwade him from it.

As it was the deſign of Gods providence to make way for Chriſts entrance into the World, and all the prophecies in the old Teſtament tended to the diſcovery of it; ſo ſince the coming of Chriſt, the end of all is to advance him in reſpect of his headſhip, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.22, 23. <hi>and hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the Church, which is his body, the fulneſs of him that fills all in all.</hi> God would advance Chriſt to the higheſt pitch, <hi>v.</hi> 21. far above all princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality and power, both in this world, and in the world to come; and there is ſtill a fulneſs wanting to Chriſt to compleat him, not only a perſonal fulneſs, but a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs belonging to him as a Head, which is the advancement God deſigns him. He is already advanced above all principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and power. He is already given as a Head to the Church; but the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatneſs of it is not till all his members be perfected, to which all his providences in the world doth ultimately tend: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the deſign of God be to honour Chriſt, and if the ſpiritual happineſs of the Church be part of that Glory and
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:136156:139"/>fulneſs of Chriſt, it muſt needs be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on by God, elſe he will want part of his compleatneſs as a Head: But this ſhall not be wanting, ſince, as all things are ſquared according to that Counſel of glorifying Chriſt as Head, ſo all things are acted for believers by that power where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he raiſed Chriſt from the grave to be their Head, which power is the Copy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which all acts which reſpect the Church, are framed, <hi>v</hi> 19. <hi>and what is the exceeding greatneſs of his power to us<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, who believe, according to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Christ when he raiſed him up from the dead.</hi> God intended the good of the Church in this very act of glorifying Chriſt, for he is made the <hi>head over all things to the Church.</hi> As if God then had preſcribed him that order, that the glory he gave him ſhould be alſo managed for the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches intereſt. Chriſt is Lord of the reſt of the World, but Head of the Church: All things are under his feet, but are not his members; He is Head over all things to the Church, and therefore to every member of the Church, the leaſt as well as the greateſt; and to the whole Church,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:136156:140"/>even that part of it which is on Earth, as well as that part which is in Heaven, who are compleated. This Church is the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt, he would be bodyleſs without it: therefore ſince Chriſt will be a head without a body, if the Church be not preſerved; in order to the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of it, all things muſt neceſſarily concur by the wiſe diſpoſal of affairs. Therefore ſince they are travelling to be where their head is, he having the government of the world, will make all things contribute aſſiſtance to them in their journey; that Chriſt may have that compleatneſs of glory, which God intends him.

            <p n="1">1. <hi>All power of government is given to Chriſt.</hi> Matth. 11.27. <hi>All things are delivered to me of my Father.

All this power was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him upon his interpoſition after the Fall of Man: He was made Lord and Chriſt, that is, anointed by God to the Government of the World.

The latter words ſome underſtand both of his Providential and Mediatory Kingdom: <hi>by the word of his power,</hi> this, ſay ſome, is referred to the Father, whoſe image Chriſt is, as ating by a delegated Authority and Commiſſion from his Father: others, to Chriſt; as, that Chriſt upholds or bears up all things by his own powerful word. <hi>Calvin</hi> thinks both may be taken, but embraceth the ſecond as being more generally received.</p>
            <p>I may offer, whether it may not be
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:136156:142"/>meant alſo, of the powerful interpoſit i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt as Mediator; whoſe intereſt in God was ſo great, that he kept up the World by his powerful Interceſſion, when all was forfeited; and God put it upon that interpoſition, into his hands as <hi>heir of all things;</hi> (who having a hand with him in Creation, underſtood both the Rights of God, and the Duty of the Creature) upon the condition of <hi>purging ſin</hi> by his Death, which he did, and thereupon went to Heaven to take Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the Government, at the right hand of God; <hi>ſat down,</hi> took his ſeat at the right hand of the Majeſty on high, as due to him by Covenant and Articles agreed on between them. I know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at preſent againſt ſuch an interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the words; but I will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend about it. All this honour was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd unto him upon his Death. For having perform'd the Condition requiſite on his part, God deputes him and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſts him with the Government of things, that he might order all things ſo, as to ſee the full Travel of his Soul.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>All this power was intended by God for this End, the good of the Church.</hi> As
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:136156:142"/>God appointed Chriſt a Prieſt for his Church to ſacrifice for them, a Prophet to teach them; ſo the other Office of King is conferred upon him for the ſame end, the advantage of the Church. God acquaints us of this End, aimed at by him in the Promiſe of the Government to him. <hi>Jer.</hi> 33.15, 16. <hi>In thoſe dayes, and at that time, will I cauſe the Branch of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs to grow up to David, and he ſhall execute judgment and righteouſneſs in the land;</hi> what is the end? <hi>In thoſe dayes ſhall Judah be ſaved, and Jeruſalem ſhall dwell ſafely.</hi> He ſhould execute Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that is, Adminiſter the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the ſalvation of <hi>Judah,</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> It was his Office both to build the Temple, and to bear the Glory, and to Rule upon his Throne; to be a Prieſt upon his Throne, to Rule as King and Prieſt, <hi>Zech.</hi> 6.12, 13. <hi>He ſhall build the temple of the Lord, even he ſhall build the temple of the Lord.</hi> The erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Church is the ſole work of Chriſt by Gods appointment. And he was to bear up the Glory of it. He ſhould rule to this End; <hi>for the Counſel of peace ſhall be between them both.</hi> If by [<hi>both</hi>] be meant,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:136156:143"/>the Lord, and the Man whoſe name is the Branch; it then chiefly aims at our Reconciliation, as wrought by Covenant between them If by [<hi>both</hi>] be meant the two Offices of King and Prieſt, and that the counſel of Peace be between them; it will extend to all the Bleſſings of the Church, to the good and Glory of the Church, which is the fruit of his Kingly, as well as the firſt Reconciliation was the fruit of his Prieſtly Office. By Peace, in Scripture, is meant the confluence of all Bleſſings; ſo that the intent of God in beſtowing thoſe Offices upon Chriſt, and ſo great a Rule, was for the good and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of that Church or Temple, which he appointed him only to build. And in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 11.9. where the Prophecy of the Government of Chriſt is, the End is expreſt to be, that none ſhould <hi>hurt or deſtroy in all his holy mountain.</hi> And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, ſince God ſet him at his right hand, and confirm'd this power unto him, after he had <hi>purged our ſins;</hi> it was certainly out of the high value God had for him, and therefore muſt be the intent of God, that he ſhould govern all things in reference to the deſign of that death,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:136156:143"/>and for the good of thoſe, whoſe ſins he had by himſelf purged. For the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing this Government, was the very end why Chriſt died and roſe again; <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.9. <hi>For to this end Christ both died and roſe and revived, that he might be Lord both of dead and living.</hi> If this were Chriſts End in dying and riſing, it was his Fathers End too, who appointed him to Death, and raiſed him by his mighty power. And ſince he was <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered for our offences, and roſe again for our juſtification, Rom.</hi> 4.25. The Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he is inveſted with, being Lord of the dead and of the living, muſt be for the ſakes of thoſe for whom he was delivered, and for whom he roſe. His Regal power, which was one end of his Death, cannot croſs the other main end, the conſtitut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a church, and carrying on the good of them that believe. The Government being in the hands not of God as Creator, but in and through the hands of a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and that Mediator which both died and roſe again peculiarly for them; therefore it cannot in the leaſt be for their hurt but advantage. The whole management of Chriſts Kingly Office in
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:136156:144"/>relation to the Church, is preſcrib'd unto Chriſt by God. God reveals to him what ſhall be done in the World, what acts he ſhall perform for the Church, and gives him a Hiſtory of all that was to be done upon the ſtage, together with an order to communicate it unto his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.1. <hi>The Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt, which God gave unto him, to ſhew unto his Servants</hi> [to be communicated to the whole Church] <hi>things that muſt ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come to paſs.</hi> Whether this Revelation was made to the human nature of Chriſt at his incarnation, as <hi>Tirinus</hi> thinks, or rather upon his aſcenſion, is not material; The whole Scheme of what was to be done in the World, is revealed here by God to Chriſt: And you find all the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the World, relating to the Church, and the end of all, is the good of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>All power thus given, and intended for this end, is actually adminiſtred by Chriſt for this end.</hi> Chriſt as the head of the Church, doth like a natural head: It never ſees, nor hears, nor exerciſeth any act of ſence only for it ſelf, but for the good of the whole Body: The eye watches
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:136156:144"/>for the body, the Tongue ſpeaks for it, the underſtanding contrives for it; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part of the head is active for the whole body. Now Chriſt as head is more bound to act for the Church militant, than for the Church triumphant; becauſe the greateſt part of his work for the Church triumphant, <hi>viz.</hi> the bringing them to Heaven, is already performed. And they are above the reach of all things in the World, and all the actions and motions in the world cannot touch or diſorder them. But the command of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the other part behind, is not yet performed, and even they are the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt, as well as thoſe in Heaven. The Apoſtle<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16, 17, 18.</note> ſeems to refer both Chriſts creation, and the preſervation of things to this title of headſhip. <hi>All things were created by him and for him, and by him all things conſiſt, and he is the head of the body the Church,</hi> and therefore the conſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and government of all things ſhall be ſubſervient to the Church, which is the body of this governing Head. The chief ſeat Chriſts Soveraignty is the Church, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.6. <hi>yet have I ſet my King upon my holy hill of Sion:</hi> And he ſtands upon

All the conqueſts of Princes redound to the advantage of that place where they fix their Reſidence. He is King of the World, but for the ſake of <hi>Sion.</hi> Chriſt did manage this charge an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently for his People; when <hi>Joſhuah</hi> had paſſed over <hi>Jordan,</hi> and firſt entered up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the conqueſt of <hi>Canaan,</hi> he ſees a man over-againſt him with a ſword drawn in his hand; <hi>Joſhua</hi> 5.13, 14. <hi>And Joſhua ſaid unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adverſaries? and he ſaid, Nay, but as Captain of the hosts of the Lord am I now come.</hi> This was Chriſt that came armed for his People, according to his charge, as their Captain and General. It was not an Angel, becauſe <hi>Joſhua</hi> worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped him; <hi>ver.</hi> 14. An Angel did not uſe to receive any Worſhip from Men; and he accepts the Worſhip, and commands him to looſe his ſhooe from his foot, for the place whereon he ſtood was holy; <hi>ver.</hi> 15.

<pb n="274" facs="tcp:136156:146"/>of it; There ſhould be no alteration or change in this great end of his, as long as the World laſts. How can Chriſt be with them, and that to the end of the world, if all the parts of his providential government were not ordered to ſerve this end, the good of the Church?

                  <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.17.</note>. They ſhall have protection from him as they are his Jewels, and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from him as they are his Sons. The Church is Chriſts Fleſh, as dear to him as our fleſh, is to us; as much his as our fleſh is ours. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.29. <hi>No man hates his own fleſh, but nouriſheth it, as Chriſt doth his Church.</hi> No man can have a higher value for hsi own fleſh, than Chriſt hath for his Church. The Church, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeaks, is nothing elſe but <hi>Chriſtus explicatus, Christ unfolded;</hi> and as conſidered in union with Chriſt, is called <hi>Christ;</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12. 'Tis the Apple of his eye; <hi>Zech.</hi> 2.8. A tender and beloved part. The Church
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:136156:148"/>is Chriſts Spouſe; the contract is made, the Eſpouſals ſhall be at the laſt Day, the Members are pick'd out one by one to be preſented to the Lamb at laſt as a Glorious Bride for him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.2.</p>
            <p>And all Gods dealings with them in the World, are but preparations of them for that State. Upon the making of the Match, God promiſes a communion of Goods; <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.20. <hi>I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulneſs,</hi> which is a fruit of Marriage, the Wife being inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in her Husbands Eſtate. When God hath given the blood of his Son for the Church, he will not deny her the ſervice of the Creatures, but Jointure her in that as one part of her Dowry. <hi>In that day will I hear the heavens,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ver.</hi> 21. In what day? in the day of betrothing, in the day of the Evangelical Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; when the contract ſhall be made between me and my Church. Heavens, Earth, Corn, Wine, and Oil; the voice and motions of all Creatures are for <hi>Jez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reel,</hi> which ſignifies the <hi>ſeed of God.</hi> This great Prince he hath a care of all his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, ſomore peculiarly of his Spouſe and Princeſs, which is his ſeed too;
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:136156:148"/>and all Creatures ſhall be her Servants. This Fatherly Relation and Affection is ſtrong and pure, not as the love which acts an ambitious man to Ambition, or a covetous man to Wealth, which reſpects nothing but the graſping and poſſeſſing the Objects they dote upon, and have nothing of love for the Objects them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, therefore deſerves not the name of Love. But it is the love of a Father, whoſe love is pure towards his children; He ſeeks their good as his own.</p>
            <p>Conſider theſe two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>God hath a peculiar love to his very Relation,</hi> and often mentions it with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, as if he loved to hear the ſound of it in his own Lips: <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.12. <hi>My vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard which is mine, is before me. Me, My, Mine.</hi> The Church is always under his Eye, ſeated in his Affection; and God is pleaſed with his propriety in them. God never calls the World, <hi>My</hi> World, though he created it; ſometimes he ſaith, the Earth is mine, but it is either to check the preſumptions of Men, who aſcribe that to themſelves which is due to the firſt Cauſe; Or to encourage his
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:136156:149"/>People in the expectation of Deliverance, becauſe all things in the Earth are at his beck: Or to ſhew his own ſufficiency, without the ſervices of his people; as when he ſaith, th eEarth is mine and the fulneſs thereof: but it is never mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſuch a way, as to diſcover any pleaſure he hath in the Relation between him and it, ſimply conſidered; but <hi>My</hi> Vineyard, <hi>My</hi> People, <hi>My</hi> Children, <hi>My</hi> Jewels, <hi>My</hi> Sanctuary, very often. So much doth God eſteem his Propriety in them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>This Relation is prevalent with God in the higheſt Emergencies and Diſtreſſes of his People.</hi> The very conſideration that they are his People, kindles his Affection, and enlivens his Strength for them. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.8. <hi>And he ſaid, Surely they are my People, Children that will not lye; ſo he was their Saviour.</hi> God is brought in, as one that had heard the cries of his Church, and had not been moved; but when he recollects himſelf, and conſiders that they were his People, and that he was in a ſpecial manner related to them, he became their Saviour; He could no
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:136156:149"/>longer bear it, but ſtirs up himſelf to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them. Nay, it hath ſo ſtrong an influence upon him, htat if this Note be often ſounded in his Ears, it doth as it were change his Voice; and when he ſeems to have a mind to caſt them off, he cannot. When <hi>Iſrael</hi> had offended by erecting and worſhipping a golden Calf, he calls them no more <hi>his</hi> People, but <hi>Moſes</hi> People; <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.7. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto Moſes, Go, get thee down, for thy people which thou broughteſt out of the land of Egypt have corrupted themſelves.</hi> As though God had not been concerned in this Miraculous conduct out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> And <hi>ver.</hi> 9. <hi>this people;</hi> as if he had had no intereſt in them, but particularizes them with diſdain. God had here diſcarded them, and turn'd them over upon <hi>Moſes</hi>'s hands, as if he would have no longer any thing to do with them; but <hi>Moſes</hi> in Prayer turns them upon God again, and would not own them as his, but pleads that they were God's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Goods; <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>Lord why doth thy wrath wax hot againſt thy people, which htou haſt brought forth out of the land of Egypt?</hi> And <hi>ver.</hi> 12. again <hi>thy</hi> People; and God
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:136156:150"/>at laſt reſumes his former Notes, <hi>ver,</hi> 14. <hi>And the Lord repented him of the evil he thought to do unto his people.</hi> Now they are Gods People again; the repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Relation, is a powerful Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torique to perſwade him to own them again, which he had caſhiered and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed off.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>The whole intereſt of God in the World lies in his Church and People.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Fiſthly.</note> He ſees little of himſelf in any part of the corrupted World, but only in them. 'Tis in the Church he hath put his Name; 'Tis there he ſees his Image, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore places his love there; and ſhall all this ſignifie nothing? Shall the Governour of the World let things go contrary to his own intereſt? They are like to him in that which is one of his greateſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, <hi>viz</hi> his Holineſs; which gives him a greater intereſt in them. 'Tis his Intereſt that is oppoſed, by an oppoſition to the Church. All the hatred any bear, it grows from the inward root of enmity againſt God himſelf; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.22. <hi>Yeae, for thy ſake are we killed all the day long.</hi> God ſurely will concern himſelf in the
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:136156:150"/>Churches intereſt, ſince it is his own. His Intereſt lies,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>In the perſons of his People.</hi> 'Tis his Inheritance<note n="8" place="margin">Iſa. <hi>19.</hi> laſt</note>. It is his Portion<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.9.</note>. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.9. <hi>The Lords portion is his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.</hi> Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part of an inheritance, and a portion, doth as particularly belong to the owner, as the whole. Every part of the ground which belongs to the Inheritance, is the Heirs, as well as the whole Field. He will not ſuffer the World, which is but the work of his hands, to lay waſte his Church which is his proper inheritance 'Tis his Treaſure; and where a mans trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is, there is his heart; and where Gods Treaſure is, there is Gods heart.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>In the ſervices and actions of the Church.</hi> If the Church ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, whom hath God to love and imitate him, and to ſhew forth his Glory? If the Candleſtick is broken, what is ſit to hold out the light to the World? He hath none in the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that do intentionally mind his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that take pleaſure in glorifying his
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:136156:151"/>Name, and writing after his Copy, and obſerving his Works. And will it ſtand with his intereſt to govern things contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to theirs, which is really his own?</p>
            <p>When God had made the World, and pronounced it good, what would it have ſignified, if he had not brought in man as his Rent-gatherer, and the Collector of his Tribute, to return it to him? And what would Man ſignifie? ſince the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted World embezles that which is Gods Right, and turns it to its own uſe; if God had not ſome honeſt ſtewards, who faithfully act for him, and give him the Glory of his Works? And God will ſpare them as a man ſpares his own Son that ſerves him. God hath no voluntary ſervice in the World but from them; therefore he is more intereſſed in their good, than in the good of the whole World beſides. The ſervices of the Church, are all the delight God hath in the World; <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 9.10. <hi>I found Iſrael like grapes in the wilderneſs, I ſaw your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as the first ripe in the figtree at her firſt time.</hi> They are as the refreſhing Wine and Grapes, as the delicious fruit of the firſt ripe Figs; wherewith a weary Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:136156:151"/> recruits his Spirits after a long and tyring journey. And God hath a greater delight in the fruit he receives from the Church, than in it ſimply as it is his inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; for no inheritance is valued but for the fruit and revenue it yields; and therefore God orders all his blackeſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences in the World, like dark clouds to be the watering pots of this his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; that the Fruit and Flowers of it may be brought to maturity, which yield him ſo much pleaſure and honour. God only is acknowledged by them and in them, as the <hi>Jews</hi> were bound to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge God the Author of their mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, by preſenting the firſt fruits of their increaſe to God. And Believers are called ſo, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.4. <hi>Theſe were redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from among men, being the firſt fruits to God and the Lamb.</hi> 'Tis by and in them that God hath the acknowledgment of all his mercies and bleſſings to the World.</p>
            <p n="6">6.<note place="margin">Sixthly.</note> 
               <hi>It cannot be but all the providences of God ſhall work to the good of his Church, if we conſider the affections of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="286" facs="tcp:136156:152"/>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>His love.</hi> What hath God in the World as an object to beſtow his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon, and communicate the rayes of his love unto, ſince he created it, but his Church? The men of the World hate him: He can ſee nothing amiable in them; for what was firſt lovely, they have defaced and blotted out; but the Church hath Gods comlineſs put upon her, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.14. <hi>it was perfect through my comlineſs which I had put upon thee, ſaith the Lord God;</hi> and he did not lay thoſe glorious colours upon her, to manage his government, or any part of it, againſt her, to deface her. Beſides their loveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which is conferred upon them by God, they have a love to God, and no man will act againſt thoſe whom he thinks to be his friends. God being <hi>purus actus,</hi> there being nothing but purity and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity in God, his love muſt be the pureſt and higheſt love, the moſt vigorous and glowing: As fire which ſets all other Bodies, ſo this all other powers in the World in motion for them. God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not love them, but he muſt wiſh all good to them, and do all good for them; for his love is not a lazy love, but hath its

God alludes to the Rings wherein men engrave the image of thoſe that are dear to them. And the <hi>Jews</hi> did in their captivity engrave the Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies of their City <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> upon their Rings, that they might not forget it<note n="*" place="margin">Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us <hi>in Iſa.</hi> 49.16.</note>. If his eye be alway upon the Church, his thoughts can never be off it in all his works.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>He loves the very gates and outworks. Pſal.</hi> 87.2. <hi>the Lord loveth the gates af Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> He loves a Cottage where a Church is, more than the ſtately Palaces of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The gates were the places where
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:136156:153"/>they conſulted together, and gave judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon affairs: God loved the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of his Saints, becauſe of the truths revealed, the ordinances adminſtred, the worſhip preſented to him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Nay one Saint is more valued by him than the whole World of the wicked.</hi> God is the God of all Creatures, but peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and of his ſeed. One <hi>Abraham</hi> is more deeply rooted in his heart, than all the World; and he doth more entitle himſelf the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> than the God of the whole World; for in that ſtyle he ſpeaks to <hi>Iſaac, Gen.</hi> 26.24. <hi>I am the God of Abraham thy Father,</hi> much more the God of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> The God of the whole Church, of which <hi>Abraham</hi> was but a member, though the Father of the faithful, and a Feoffee of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. God hath a greater value for one ſincere Soul, than for a whole City. He ſaves a <hi>Lot,</hi> and burns a <hi>Sodom:</hi> Yea, than for a whole World, he drowns a World, and preſerves a <hi>Noah.</hi> He ſecures his Jewels, whilſt he flings away the pebbles.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>He loves them ſo, that he overlooks
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:136156:153"/>their crabbed and perverſe miſconstructions of his providence.</hi> When the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had jealous thoughts of him, and of <hi>Moſes</hi> his inſtrument, when they ſaw that mighty <hi>Egyptian</hi> Army juſt at their heels, and themſelves cooped up between Mountains, Forts and Waters, God doth not upon this provoking murmuring draw up his cloudy Pillar to Heaven, but puts it in the rear of them, when before it had marched in the van<note n="*" place="margin">

And his own Son muſt bleed and dye, before the Church of the Gentiles could be fixed. Men delight in that which hath coſt them much Pains, and a great Price.

               <hi>The Prayers of the Church have a might force with God to this end.</hi> God is entitled a God hearing Prayer; and what prayers ſhould God hear, if not the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of his Church, which aim at Gods Glory in their own good? Though the prayers of the Church may in ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular fail, yet in general they do not; becauſe they ſubmit their deſires to the Will of God, which always works what is beſt for them.</p>
            <p>When God would do any mighty work in the World, he ſtirs up his people to pray for it; and their prayers by his own appointment have a mighty influence upon the Government of the World: For when they come before him in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the Church in general, he doth
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:136156:156"/>indulge them a greater liberty and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and as it were a kind of Authority over him, than upon other occaſions of their own: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.11. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, the holy one of Iſrael, and his maker, ask of me things to come, concerning my ſons, and concerning the work of my hands command you me.</hi> God would be more poſitively, conſidently, and familiarly dealt with, about the concerns of his ſons, though they were things to come to paſs in after Ages. And indeed the prayers of the Church have a powerful and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible efficacy on the great actions and overturnings which are in the World. The Being of the World is maintained by them from ſinking, according to the <hi>Jews</hi> ſaying, <hi>ſine ſtationibus non ſubſiſteret mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus;</hi> (ſtanding in prayer was their uſual prayer-geſture.) And that they have actually ſuch a force, is evident, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.3, 4. An Angel hath a golden Cenſer with Incenſe, to offer it with the prayers of the Saints, upon the Altar which was before the Throne. And <hi>ver.</hi> 5. the Cenſer wherein their prayers were offered, was filled with the fire of the Altar, and caſt into the Earth; and there were Voices,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:136156:156"/>Thundrings, Lightnings, and Earthquakes. When the prayers of the Saints were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to God, and aſcended upon before him, that is, (were very pleaſing to him:) The iſſue is, the Angel fills the Cenſer with fire of the Altar, and thereby cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes great commotions and alterations in the World; ſignifying, that the great changes of the World are an anſwer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe prayers which are offered unto God; for fire is taken from that altar up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they were offered, and flung into the World. And it muſt needs be that the prayers of the Church ſhould have an influence on the government of the World.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe God hath a mighty delight in the prayers of his people.

Prayer awakes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to judge the Enemies of the Church. A Parent delights, not in the bare crying, or the voice of his Child ſimply conſidered in it ſelf, but in the ſignifications and effects of it. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in the matter of their prayers, it being ſo agreeable to his own heart and will, and in the ſence they have of the ſufferings of the whole body.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Becauſe Prayer is nothing elſe but a pleading of Gods promiſes.</hi> Unto this they are directed by that Spirit which knows the mind of God, and Marſhals their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions according to his will. Now as God turns his own decrees and purpoſes concerning his Church into promiſes to them, ſo the Church turns thoſe promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes into prayers for them: So that promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes being for the good of the Church, and there being an exact harmony be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe promiſes and the Churches prayers, all thoſe providences which are the iſſue of thoſe promiſes, and the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of the Churches prayers, muſt needs
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:136156:157"/>be for the Churches good.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Becauſe there are united ſupplications and pleadings both in Heaven and Earth;</hi> all the hands of the whole Family in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth are concerning in their petitions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Chriſt intercedes for the Church,</hi> who alwaies deſires mercy and deliverance for them in the appointed time, <hi>Zech.</hi> 1.12. <hi>How long wilt thou not have mercy on Jeruſalem?</hi> and the iſſue is alwayes gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious: For, <hi>v.</hi> 13.

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Angels in all probability plead for the Church,</hi> as we have already heard: 'Tis likely they offer and preſent that to God which makes for his glory, and that is the good of the Church. Angels ſurely deſire that which their head doth, who is<note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="298" facs="tcp:136156:158"/>of the Church, which is part of that Family they are of? And we know, that the greatneſs of our joy is ſuted to the meaſure of our deſires; where our joy is moſt triumphant, it implies that our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires before were moſt vehement.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Glorified Saints are not ſurely behind.</hi> The rich man in the Parable deſired his Friend on Earth might not come into that place of torment<note n="*" place="margin">

If he deſired it, that by the preſence of his cmpanions in ſin, his own torments might not be increaſed; Do not the Saints in Heaven deſire the preſence of the whole Church, that their happineſs in that of the whole body may be compleated? If the Head Chriſt be not compleat without the body, the members of the body cannot be compleat without one another. The ſouls of them that were ſlain for the word of God, cry under the Altar for vengeance on them that dwell on the Earth, as <hi>Revel.</hi> 6.9, and 10. <hi>How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?</hi> Will
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:136156:158"/>not their kindneſs to their fellow-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, be as ſtrong as their juſtice? And their love for the good of their Friends draw out their prayers as well as their deſire of vengeance on their Enemies? Why may they not as well pray for us, as we praiſe God for them? Had they not ſome likeneſs to their great Maſter whilſt they were on Earth? and ſhall they not be more like to him now they ae in Heaven, and behold his face, and feel all the ſtirrings of his heart? And if they have no ſence at all of the Churches ſufferings, how ſhall they be like to him who hath? As their bodies ſhall be like the glorious body of Chriſt at the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, are not their Souls now like his glorious Soul? merciful, and compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and ſympathizing in all the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Church? and can this be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome breathings for a full compleating of the Churches freedom? Are ſuch deſires and pleas any hindrance to their preſent happineſs? 'Tis ſo far from that, that it doth rather further their glory, which cannot be compleat, as the glory of Chriſt, as head, is not mounted to the higheſt pitch of glory, till his myſtical
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:136156:159"/>body be all gathered in, and lodged with him. If it be thus, will God do any thing prejudicial to the Church, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the combin'd deſires of all thoſe that are ſo ner him? If God doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſtir up himſelf upon the ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of one man, grant an order upon his petition according to his mind, and if the prayers of one faithful <hi>Moſes,</hi> or <hi>Elias,</hi> or <hi>Samuel,</hi> have ſuch a kind of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power in them, much more is the jovnt force of ſo many prayers twiſted together.</p>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>God will in the greateſt exigencies find out means for the protection of his Church.</hi> This will be till his providence be at an end.

Jeſus Chriſt is the Churches Head and General: Chriſt the Head watcheth for the good of the Church, the Body. He muſt be deſtroyed before the Church can. There is a mighty Arm, which though it may for a time ſeem withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, will in the end be ſtretched out, and get it ſelf the victory.

            <p>If all the Providence of God be for the good of the Church; If his eyes run to and fro to ſhew himſelf ſtrong for them; it affords matter of great comfort. His Providence is continual for them,*,<note place="margin">Zech. 4.</note> he hath ſeven pipes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey kindneſs to them, as well as ſeven Lamps whereby to diſcern their ſtreights. His Providence is as vaſt as
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:136156:168"/>his Omniſcience: The number of Pipes belonging to the Candleſtick of the Church is exact according to the number of Lamps. The Churches Miſery cannot be hid from Gods eye, let it be in what part of the Earth ſoever, for his eyes run to and fro throughout the whole Earth, and his ſight excites his ſtrength. Upon the ſight of their diſtreſſed condition, he watches only for the fitteſt opportunity to ſhew himſelf ſtrong for them. And when that opportunity comes, he is ſpeedy in the Deliverance of them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.10. <hi>He rode upon a cherub, and did fly, yea, he did flye upon the wings of the wind.</hi> He doth not only ride upon a Cherub, but flye. His wings are nothing but wind, which hath the quickeſt and the ſtrongeſt motion, which moves the greateſt bodies, and turns down all before it.

<pb n="319" facs="tcp:136156:168"/>Church. Let there be but ſincerity on our parts, in our attempts of ſervice upon Gods call, and we need not fear a want of Providence on Gods part: God never calls any to ſerve his Church in anyſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but he doth both Spirit and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them. God hath in his common Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence ſuited the nature of every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to that place in which he hath ſet it in the World: and will he not much more in his ſpecial Providence ſuit every one to that place he calls them to, for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his Church? He did not forſake Chriſt in redeeming his Church, neither will he forſake any in aſſiſting his Church. When <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> would boldly demand the body of our Saviour, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence made the way plain before him, he meets with no check, neither from <hi>Pilate</hi> nor the Prieſts<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 27.58.

<pb n="320" facs="tcp:136156:169"/>Not the meaneſt ſincere Chriſtian but is under Gods eye for good.

His eye is upon them to ſee their dangers,

He will not ſurely be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of the afflictions of his Creatures, His people are not only his Creatures but his new Creatures, their bodies are not only created by him, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed by his Son.

And he cannot damn you Believing, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he renounce his Sons Mediation, and his own Promiſe.

Had God brought <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt</hi> in the time of the Kings that were friends to them from a kindly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> there had been no character of a Divine power, though there had been of a divine truth appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in the caſe; but he ſet apart that time for their deliverance when he was to conteſt with the mightieſt oppoſition from the whole body of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Nation, who had forgot <hi>Joſeph</hi> their great Benefactor. Had nto the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples been in a great Storm ready to be
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:136156:175"/>caſt away, and Chriſt aſleep, till they were in extremity; they had not ſeen ſuch<note n="*" place="margin">Iſa. 33.7, 8. &amp;c.</note> viſible marks of the extenſiveneſs of their Maſters power. When the hearts of the ſtrong men fainted, when the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> would not hear the Embaſſadors of Peace, when they had broke their former Covenant, reſolved to invade the Land, when their Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and deſpair had arreſted all their hopes, <hi>Now,</hi> when all things are in ſuch a deplorable ſtate, <hi>will I ariſe ſaith the Lord, now will I be exalted, now will I lift up my ſelf.</hi> God was not aſleep or unconcerned, but he ſate ſtill, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ſuch a ſeaſon. Now, is three times repeated. The Pſalmiſt gives us a Record of this in his particular caſe. When the waters of his affliction were many, the Enemy ſtrong, and too ſtrong for him, their ſtrength edged with an intenſe hatred, then God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be his ſtay, and prevents them in the day of his Calamity, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.16, 17, 18. God lets his Enemies be too ſtrong for him, that he might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear his only ſtay, without any mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Davids</hi> ſtrength in the caſe.
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:136156:175"/>When the <hi>Jews</hi> thruſt Chriſt out of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> led him to the Brow of the Hill, and were ready to caſt him down, then, and not till then, he frees himſelf out of their hands, and diſappoints the effects of their rage. As Chriſt dealt thus for him ſelf, ſo he deals for his Church in all Ages.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>God glorifies his Wiſdom. His eyes run to and fro throughout the whole earth to ſhew himſelf ſtrong;</hi> 'tis not a bare ſtrength that God would ſhew, or ſuch a Power which we call in man a brutiſh valor, without wit or skill; but to ſhew his ſtrength with his Wiſdom, when all his other Attributes may be glorified with that of his Power. When all worldly helps are departed, we can as little aſcribe our ſecurity to our own wiſdom and induſtry, as to our own ſtrength and power. The Phyſitians skill is beſt evidenced in maſtering a deſperate Diſeaſe. He will bring the Councils of the Heathen to nought<note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 33.10.</note>. He will let them counſel, he will let them deviſe and carry on their Councils near to Execution, that he may ſhew, that is the ſtrength of Hell is no match for his

When the ruine was inevitable as to man, their preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation was moſt regarded by God. Had God ſtopped <hi>Pharaoh</hi> as his firſt March by raiſing ſome Mutiny in his Army, his mercy to his people as well as his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er againſt his Enemies had not been ſo conſpicuous. The more deſperate things are, the fitter ſubject for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Gods kindneſs. Had God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:136156:176"/>the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> through a rich and fruitful Country, it would have obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the glory of his care of them, which was more ſignal in directing them through a Barren Deſert, crowded with fiery Serpents, without Bread to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh them, or Water to cool them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he manifeſted himſelf to be both their Caterer and Phyſitian. <hi>Moſes</hi> was never more peculiarly under Gods protection, no not when he had the whole Guard of <hi>Iſrael</hi> about him in the Wilderneſs, than when his Mother had expoſed him to the River forlorn, in a pitched Ark, and forſaken by his Siſter, who ſtood a loof off to ſee how Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence would conduct him. When <hi>Laban</hi> was poſſeſſed with Fury againſt <hi>Jacob,</hi> God countermands it, and iſſues out his own order to him, how he ſhould behave himſelf towards his Son<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 31.24, 29.</note>. God times his kindneſs, ſo that it may appear to be nothing elſe but Grace, Grace with a Witneſs; that his people may be able to underſtand the very particularities of it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.18. <hi>therefore will the Lord wait that he may be gracious unto you:</hi> He leaves them therefore for a while to

God would have his mercy valued, and 'tis fit it ſhould. And when is a Calm more grateful than after the bittereſt Storm, attended with the higheſt deſpair? Gods mercy in ſparing <hi>Iſaac</hi> after the knife was at his throat, was more welcome and more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious both to Father and Son, than if God had revealed his intent to <hi>Abraham</hi> in the three days Journey to the Mount <hi>Moriah.</hi> But God ſuſpending his Soul in bitterneſs all that time prepared his heart for the valuation of that mercy. When humane help forſaketh us, God moſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.10. <hi>When my father and mother forſake me, then the Lord will take me up.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>God glorifies his Righteouſneſs and Juſtice.</hi> There is a meaſure of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs God ſtays for, which will be an object of his Juſtice without exception. When the meaſure of a peoples Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs

Hereby God clears the Juſtice of his proceedings, that he exerciſed patience ſo long; that things were come to that paſs, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his People or his Enemies muſt be deſtroyed. As the caſe was with the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> had not God marvellouſly appeared, every man of them had been cut off or reduced to Slavery. The Dye was caſt, either the <hi>Egyptians</hi> or the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> muſt be defeated: either God muſt appear for his Church, or none would be left in the World to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs him. In ſuch a caſe the Juſtice of God is more unexceptionable: No man has any ſemblance for complaining of him. For he ſtruck not till the ſafety of his Adverſaries was inconſiſtent with his own Honour and Intereſt in the World. When men come to ſuch a height, as to ſlight, and reſolve to break the laws of God, then is the time for the Honour of his Righteouſneſs in his own inſtitutions, to vex them in his ſore diſpleaſure, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.3, 5. <hi>Then

Times of extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity make us more humble, and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity like the Plow, fits us for the ſeed of Mercy. The Gardeners digging up the clods is but to prepare the earth for the receiving and nourſhing ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Plants he intends to put into its Womb.

It doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly daſh the preſent deſigns, but diſhear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten future attempts. The <hi>Egyptians</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their overthrow at the Bed Sea never attempted to diſturb them in their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in the Wilderneſs.

'Tis not the face but the back parts of Providence which we behold; why then ſhould we uſurp an authority beyond our ability, and make our ſelves Gods Judges; as if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Wiſdom and Power were bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within the narrow compaſs of our purblind Reaſons? His ways are beyond our tracing, and his Councils too high for our ſhort meaſures. Since therefore God ſatisfies the Righteouſneſs of his own Will, let us ſubmit our curioſity to his Wiſdom, and forbear our Cenſures of that exact righteouſneſs and ſuperlative wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which we cannot comprehend.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Therefore, <hi>First, ſix this into your minds, that God is righteous, wiſe and good in every thing.</hi> Good, therefore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be hurtful to his People: Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, therefore nothing Unjuſt: Wiſe,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:136156:189"/>therefore nothing to vain. Our injurious thoughts of him make us ſo unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table towards him, and greater Cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of his righteous ways, than we are of mens wicked actions. Clouds and Darkneſs are about him: our eye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pierce through his darkneſs, or ſee the frame of his counſels; yet let theſe Principles be kept as the Center, that <hi>Righteouſneſs and Judgment are the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation of his Throne</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 9.2.</note>. He is righteous in his darkneſs, wiſe in his cloudineſs; though his Judgments are unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to us, and his ways paſt finding out, by our moſt induſtrious inquiſitions; and a depth of knowledge and wiſdom there is in them too deep for us to meaſure<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 9.33.</note>. God was always Righteous, Wiſe, and Good, he is the ſame ſtill: Though the motions of the Planets b e contrary, yet the Sphere where they are fixed, the natures wherewith they were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, are the ſame ſtill. Though the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences of God have various motions, yet the Spring of his Counſel the Rule of his Goodneſs, the Eye of his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the Arm of his Power are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered: He acts by the ſame Rule, diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:136156:189"/>by the ſame Wiſdom, orders accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſame Righteouſneſs; he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable in the midſt of the change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able effects of Providence. The Sun is the ſame body, which admits of no inward alteration, keeps exactly its own motion, though its appearances are ſometimes ruddy, ſometimes clear, its heat ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more faint, at another time more ſcorching, its diſtance ſometimes nearer, ſometimes farther off. He muſt be very ignorant that thinks the object upon which we look through a Priſme or Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonal Glaſs change their colours as often as they are repreſented ſo, in the various turnings of the Glaſs. You ſee the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulations and wavings of a Clain which hangs perpendicularly, one part moves this way, and another that way, but the hand that holds it, or the beam to which it is faſtned is firm and ſteddy.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Diſtinguiſh between preparations to the main work, and the perfection of the work;</hi> between the motions of Gods eyes, and the diſcovery of his ſtrength, his eyes move before his Power. The neglect of this was the cauſe of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> uncharitable Cenſures of the kindneſs
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:136156:190"/>of God: they interpret Gods reducing them into the Straits near the Red Sea, a deſign for their deſtruction, which was but the preparation for their compleat deliverance, in a way moſt glorious to God, and moſt comfortable and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious to themſelves.</p>

God treads his Grapes in a Wine preſs, to draw from thence a delicate Wine, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the juyce for his own uſe, which would elſe wither upon the ſtalk, and dry up to nothing. We judge not the Hosbandman angry with his ground for tearing it with his Plow, nor cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure an Artificer for hewing his Stones, or beating his Iron, but expect patiently the iſſue of the deſign. Why ſhould we not pay the ſame reſpect to God which we do to men in their Arts; ſince we are leſs capable of being Judges of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible Wiſdom, than of the
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:136156:190"/>skill of our fellow Creatures? God in his croſs Providences prepares the Church for fruitfulneſs whileſt he Plows it. He may ſeem to be digging up the Bowels of the Church, while he is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preparing to lay the foundation in <hi>Sion</hi> for the raiſing a noble ſtructure; and in what ſhape ſoever he appears in his preparations, he will in his perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of it appear in glory, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.16. <hi>When the Lord ſhall build up Sion, he ſhall appear in glory,</hi> and evidence that he was reſtoring, whilſt we thought him deſtroying; and healing, whilſt we thought him wounding. As God hath ſetled a gradual Progreſs in his works of Creation, ſo by degrees he brings his everlaſting Counſels to perfection. The ſeaſons of the year are not jumbled together, but orderly ſucceed one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; &amp; the coldneſs of the Winter is but a preparation for a ſeaſonable Spring, and a Summer-Harveſt. We do not unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly accuſe God of diſorder in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon works, why ſhould we do it in his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial works of Providence? we do not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parage the Muſitians skill for the jarring and unintelligble touches in the tuning
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:136156:191"/>Inſtrument, but rather wait for the Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he intends to play: If we ſtay for Gods fuller Touches of this great Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the World in the way of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, it will, like <hi>Davids</hi> Harp, chaſe away that evil Spirit from us which is now too apt to cenſure him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Fix not your eye only upon the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible operations of providenee, but the ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate end.</hi> As in a Watch the various wheels have different motions, yet all ſubſervient to one end, to tell the true hour of the day, and the motion of the Sun; ſo are all the Providences of God. Should any have been preſerved in the Deluge upon ſome high mountain, who had not known the deſign of the Ark, and had ſeen it floating upon ſuch a Maſs of Waters, he would have judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the People in it in a deplorable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and have concluded that it would have broke againſt a Mountain, or been overturned by the Waves; yet that was <hi>Noah</hi>'s preſervative. Had any of us been with Chriſt, &amp; acknowledged him the Saviour of the World, and yet ſeen him Crucified in ſuch a manner by men, and judged only by that; what
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:136156:191"/>wiſe and what juſt conſtructeion ſhould we have made of that Providence? much the ſame as ſome of his Diſciples did, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.21. <hi>We truſted that it had been he which ſhould have redeemed</hi> Iſrael. But the whole deſign is ſpoiled, we were fools, and he an Impoſtor. Yet this which ſeemed to be the ruine of Redemption, was the neceſſary high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to it by Gods conſtitution. No o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way was it to be procured, <hi>ver.</hi> 26. <hi>Ought not Chriſt to have ſuffered theſe things, and to have entred into his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry?</hi> His entrance into Glory to perfect our Salvation, was the end of the ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſuffering, wherein he laid the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. As they charge Chriſt with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture, not conſidering the end, ſo do we God with unrighteouſneſs, when we conſider not his aim. The end both beautifies and crowns the work; The remarks of Gods Glory in the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are better drawn from the ends of the Creatures and their joynt ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency to them, than from any one ſingle piece of the Creation. We muſt not only conſider the preſent end, but the remote end, becauſe God in his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:136156:192"/>towards his Church hath his end for after times. God acts for ends at a great diſtance from us, which may not be compleated till we are dead and rotten. How can we judge of that which reſpects a thing ſo remote from us, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we view it in that Relation? Gods aims in former Providences were things to come, his aims in preſent Providences are things to come. As the matter of the Churches Prayers, ſo the objects of Gods Providences are things to come, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.11. <hi>Ask me of things to come, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my ſons.</hi> The matter of their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers then were, that God would order all things for the coming of the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> The matter of the Churches Prayer now is, that God would order all things for the perfecting the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> in his myſtical Body. The whole frame of Providence is for one intire deſign. 'Tis one intire Book with ſeven Seals<note n="*" place="margin">Rev. 5.1.</note>. The beginning of a Book, as well as the middle, hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the end. The deſign of Gods Book of Providence is but one in all the ſeven Seals and periods of time.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Conſider not only one ſingle act of Providence, but the whole ſcheme to make a
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:136156:192"/>concluſion.</hi> The motions of his eyes are various, but all end in diſcoveries of his ſtrength. Men do not argue from one ſingle propoſition, but draw the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion from ſeveral propoſitions knit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. 'Tis by ſuch a Spritual Logick we are to make our concluſions from the ways of Providence. As in the reading Scripture,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Burges</hi> of juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, part. 2. Serm. 2. p 12.</note> if we take not the whole Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, we may make not only nonſenſe, but Blaſpehmy, as in that of the Palmiſt, <hi>Thau art not a God that hath pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs.</hi> If a man ſhould read only, <hi>thou art not a God,</hi> and make a full ſtop there, it would be blaſphemy; but reading the whole verſe, it is excellent ſence, and an honourable declaration of Gods holineſs. Such Errors will be committed in reading the Books of Providence, if we fix our eyes only in one place, and make a full ſtop where God hath not made any. We judge not of a Picture by the firſt daught, but the laſt lines; not by one ſhadow or colour, but by the whole compoſure. The Wiſdom of God is beſt judged of by the view of the harmony of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, The ſingle threads of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:136156:193"/>may ſeem very weak, or knotty and uneven, and ſeem to adminiſter juſt occaſion of Cenſure; but will it not as much raiſe the admiration to ſee them all woven into a curious piece of branched work? Conſider therefore Gods ways of working; but fully judge nothing, till the concluſion, for that is to judge before the time. Judge not then of Providence at the firſt appearance, God may ſo loſe the glory of his work, and vou the comfort.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly.</hi> The third Duty. <hi>Inquire into providence, and interpreat all publick providences by this Rule.</hi> We muſt ſearch into it, though we are not able to find out all the reaſons of it. What can be a braver ſtudy than that which is the object of Gods eternal counſel? We are conformed to God in our Wills, when we have the ſame ends in our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and we are conformed to God in our underſtandings, when we have the ſame object of our thoughts. Some Providences have their interpretation written in their foreheads, we may run and read, ſuch as his ſifna Judgments in the World, which expreſs the very
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:136156:193"/>ſin for which they are inflicted; others are wrapt up in a harder ſhell and more covers, and therefore more labour is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to reach the kernel; ſome are too high for our knowledge, none for our enquiry. 'Tis our duty to ſeek after God, though we can never arrive to a perfect know ledge of him. <hi>Job</hi> 1.7. <hi>Canſt thou by ſearching find out God; canſt thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?</hi> He prohibits not the ſearching, though he aſſerts the impoſſibility of finding him out to perfection. What hath God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us faculties for, but to ſearch after him? and we muſt not do it to ſatisfie our curioſity, but to encreaſe our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and conſequently our admiration of his wiſe and powerful care. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence muſt be uſed too. Our firſt thoughts about things of concernment, are uſually confuſed; ſo are our firſt ſights of Providence. Providence is a great deep, deep things are not ſeen without ſtooping down. We muſt <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> as the Angels do when they ſearch into the things of the Goſpel<note n="*" place="margin">1 Pet. 1.12.</note>. But let this aim of God at the good of his Church be the rule of your inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:136156:194"/>Without this compaſs to ſteer our judgments by, we may both loſe and rack our ſelves in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Providence, and fortify our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Atheiſm and Ignorance inſtead of our Faith. I muſt confeſs the ſtudy of Providence is in ſome reſpect more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult than in the former Ages of the World, becauſe God ſeems to manage things in the Church more by his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom than Power, which is not ſo intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible by man as the ſenſible effects of his ſtrength. That attribute he mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted moſt in Miraculous ways, and the viſible Miniſtry of Angels, as we read in Scripture ſtories; now he employs his Wiſdom more in ordering ſecond cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in ordinary ways to his own high, merciful, and juſt ends. Yet ſince the diſcovering of Chriſt God hath given us a rule whereby we may diſcern much of his Wiſdom in the knowledge of his end. As the knowledge of Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves the Veil from the Scripture in our reading of it<note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. 3.14, 15, 16.</note> 
               <hi>The ſame Veil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in the reading of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which Veil is done away in Christ,</hi> (which Veil is ſtill upon the <hi>Jews</hi>) and
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:136156:194"/>makes us underſtand thoſe parts of the Old Teſtament, which otherwiſe would be utterly obſcure; ſo in the reading the Books of Providence, the knowledg of this end of God in them, will help us to underſtand the meaning of that which otherwiſe would non-plus the Reaſon of man. He that knows the end of one that is making a Watch, will not wonder at his framing ſmall wheels, and filing little pins; but he that underſtands nothing of the deſign, would count it ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous for a man ſo to trifle away his time. Without the knowledge of this end, we ſhall expoſe our ſelves to miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble miſtakes. As <hi>Plutarch</hi> miſtook the cauſe of the ceaſing of Oracles, aſcribing it to the change of the nature of the Soil, not affording thoſe exhalations as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly; or the death of the Demons which gave thoſe Oracles. He had judged otherwiſe, had be known or believed the riſing of a higher power, the Sun of Righteouſneſs in the World, who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ſilence upon thoſe Angels of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; the moſt famous Oracles in the World ceaſing about the time of Chriſt. To imagine to interpret the motions
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:136156:195"/>of Providence without a knowledge of Chriſt, and the deſign of God for hi<hi rend="sup">s</hi> Church, is as vain as to imagine we can paint a ſound, or underſtand a colour by our ſmell. Correct Senſe by Reaſon in this work, and Reaſon by Faith. To what end hath God preſcribed Faith to ſuccour us in the weakneſs of Reaſon, if it had been capable to underſtand his ways without it, and if we make no uſe of it upon ſuch occaſions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> A fourth Duty. <hi>Conſider the former Providences God hath wrought for the Church in the paſt Ages.</hi> Let him not loſe the preſent glory of his paſt works, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.18. <hi>This ſhall be written for the Generation to come; and the People which ſhall be created ſhall Praiſe the Lord.</hi> Even for that work of his which is written to be done in former Ages. God loves to have his former works read and pleaded. 'Tis a keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſtanding praiſe of him in the World. We have had the benefit of them, it is fit God ſhould have the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of them, from us as well as from thoſe who immediately injoyed them. Our good was bo und up in every former
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:136156:195"/>preſervation of the Church. If the Candleſtick had been broken, where had the Candle been? Had the Church been deſtroyed, how could the Goſpel have been tranſmitted to us? Let the Duty we owe to Gods Glory, engage us to a conſideration of them; and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit we have had by them alſo, incite us. We uſually forget not things that are ſtrange, nor things that are profitable; His works of old have been works of Wonder in themſelves, and profitable to us. To what end are the Praiſes of God diſcovered to the Generations to come, but that they ſhould reflect thoſe Praiſes to Heaven again, and convey them down to the Generations follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.4. <hi>Shewing to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to come the Praiſes of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>This will help us in our inquiries into preſent Providences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a beautiful connexion between former and latter Providences; they are but ſeveral links of one Chain. The Principle and End is the ſame. That God from whence they come, that Chriſt to which they tend, is the ſame yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, to day and for ever. What
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:136156:196"/>god doth now is but a Copy of what he pouttrayed in his word as done in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages; There are the ſame characters of Wildom upon both; The ſame good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the ſame deſign in both. The Births of Providence are all of a like temper and diſpoſition. We cannot miſs of the underſtanding of them, if we compare them with the ancient Copies: For God is in the Generation of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous the ſame God ſtill. God is the ſame, his ends are the ſame, the events will be the ſame.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It will ſupport our Faith.</hi> The reaſon of our diffidence of God in the cauſe of the Church, is the forgetfulneſs of his forwer appearances for her. O! if we did remember his former goodneſs, we ſhould not be ſoready to doubt of his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture care. This was the Pſalmiſts care in his deſpondencies, and in his overwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming troubles of Spirit, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.9. <hi>Harh Gob forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger ſhut up his tender mercies?</hi> but <hi>verſe</hi> 19. He concludes it his <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity,</hi> and reſolves upon a review of the Records or Gods ancient works for his People, <hi>and the years of the right
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:136156:196"/>hand of the moſt High,</hi> thoſe times where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he declared his Power and his glory, and ſo proceeds to the top of all their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances, <hi>viz.</hi> that out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Doth Gods Wiſdom decay, or his Power grow feeble? Is not his Intereſt the ſame? Is he not a God ſtill like himſelf? Is not his glory as dear to him as before? Hath he caſt off his affection to his own name? Why ſhould not he then do the ſame works, ſince he hath the ſame concern? God himſelf to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage us calls them to our remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.2. <hi>Is my hand ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that I cannot redeem? or have I no Power to Deliver? Behold, at my rebuke I do dry up the Sea, I make the Rivers a Wilderneſs, &amp;c.</hi> Am not I the ſame God that dried up the Sea, that wrought thoſe ancient wonders which amaz'd the World? what doth your diſtruſt ſigniſie but the impair of my Power? Rouſe up your ſelves to a conſideration of them: And thence gather freſh ſupplies to ſtrengthen you in your preſent depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon me. He puts us in mind of them, becauſe we are apt to forget them. <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.6. When it is ſaid <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
               <pb n="376" facs="tcp:136156:197"/>believed in the Lord, and it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted to him for Righteouſneſs. God anſwered him, <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees,</hi> keep up thy Faith, and to that end, remember what I did for thee before in calling thee; caſt thy eye upon that place whence I delivered thee; either from the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of the place, or the perſecution he was in for the true Worſhip of God. And as God puts him in mind of his Mercy he had ſhewn to him before, for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of his Faith; ſo the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God have made uſe of them to this end. <hi>Goliah</hi>'s Sword was counted by <hi>David</hi> the fitteſt for his defence in his flight, becauſe it had been a Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Gods former deliverance of him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.9. When he asks for a ſword or Spear, <hi>Abimelech</hi> ſaid, <hi>the Sword of</hi> Golian <hi>whom thou ſteweſt, is here. And</hi> David <hi>ſaid, there is none like that, give it me.</hi> How haſtily he catches at it! There is none like that Sword that hath ſo ſignal a mercy writ upon it. That very Sword will not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſend me againſt my enemies, but guard my Faith againſt thoſe Temptations
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:136156:197"/>that would invade it. This encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Faith and Hope is the end of God in his tranſmiſſion of the records of his former Providences to us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78 6, 7. <hi>That the Generation to come might know them, and declare them to their Children;</hi> From one poſterity to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>that thay might ſet their hope in God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>It will enliven our Prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis a mighty Plea in Prayer. How often doth <hi>David</hi> urge it? Thou haſt been my help, thou haſt delivered my Soul from Death, wilt thou not deliver my feet from falling? And in the Churches concerns too. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 11, 12. <hi>Seek the Lord and hie Strength, ſeek his face continually: remember the marvellous works that he hath done.</hi> A reflection upon what God hath done, ſhould be joyned with our deſires of what we would have God to do for us. When <hi>Moſes</hi> was praying upon the top, while <hi>Iſrael</hi> was fighting with <hi>Amalek.</hi> at the foot of the hill, he had the Rod of God in his hand, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17.9. That miraculous Rod which had amazed <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> whoſe motion Summoned all
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:136156:198"/>the Plagues upon him. That Rod which had ſplit the Sea for their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, broached the Rock for their thirſt, and had been inſtrumental in many Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles: certainly <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhewed this Rod to God, and pleaded all thoſe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful deliverances God had wrought inſtrumentally by it. No doubt but he caried it with him to ſhew to God for a Plea, as well as to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to ſpirit their Reſolutions againſt their Enemies.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>It will prevent much Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A forget fulneſs of his former works is one cauſe of our preſent provocations. It was ſo in the caſe of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſin, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.7. <hi>They remembred not the multitude of his mercies, but provoked thee at the Sea, even at the Red Sea:</hi> they had loſt the memory of ſo many Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and which aggravated their Sin, <hi>they provoked him at the Sea, at the red Sea;</hi> they provoked him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a preſent indigency, as as well as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt former mercy: they provoked him in that place of ſtraits where all the powers on Earth could not have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved them, had Heaven neglected them.
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:136156:198"/>The provocation you may ſee, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.11, 12. Which ſprang from a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſs of his kindneſs ſo lately ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them. How apt are we to forget old Mercies, when we are ſo naturally apt to blot out of our memories mercies newly received? If this were well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered by men, it would prevent their enterpriſes againſt the Church, and conſequently their ſhame and Ruin. Are there Records of any who have hardned themſelves againſt God and proſpered<note n="*" place="margin">Job 9 4.</note>? How might in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection be ſeen the fruſtrations of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, diſgracing of attempts, ſhowers of Fury and Vengeance from Heaven upon the heads of ſuch? The reaſon why the wonderful works of God were to be made known to poſterity, was that they might not be as their Fathers, as Stubborn and Rebellious Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<note n="*" place="margin">Pſal 7 8 6 8.</note> of men; if they did conſider thoſe tranſactions of God in and for his Church, they could no more think to ſtop the breath of perpetual powerful Providence, than to bridle in a Storm, or ſtop the motion of the Sun. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clud this. Gods Providential Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:136156:199"/>ments are to be remembred: though they are for the puniſhment of the age that feel them, they are alſo for the inſtruction of the age which ſucceeds them, <hi>tell</hi>

The works of Providence as well as the Doctrine of God, are parts of a Childs Catechiſm; they are to keep up the conſideration of them in themſelves, and hand them in inſtruction to their Children.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The fifth Duty. <hi>Act faith on Gods Providence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Times of trouble ſhould be times of confidence; fixedneſs of heart on God, would prevent fears of heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11.2.7. <hi>He ſhall not be affraid of evil tydings, his heart is fixed,</hi> how? <hi>truſting in the Lord: his heart is eſtabliſhed, they ſhall not be moved.</hi> Otherwiſe without it, we ſhall be as light as a Cork moved with every blaſt of evil tydings, our hopes will ſwim or ſink according to the news we hear. Providence would ſeem to ſleep, unleſs Faith and Prayer awakened it. The Diſciples had but
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:136156:199"/>little Faith in their Maſters account, yet that little Faith awakened him in a Storm, and he relieved them. Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief only doth diſcourage God from ſhewing his power in taking our parts. <hi>Every one will walk in the name of his God, and we will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever, Micah</hi> 4.5. Heathens will truſt in their Idols, and ſhall not we in that God that lives for ever? Have we any reaſon to have a leſs eſteem of our confidence in God, than Heathens had of, and in their Idols? We ſhould do our duty, which is Faith and Hope, and leave God to do his work, which is mercy and kindneſs. By unbelief we deny his providence, diſparage his Wiſdom, and ſtrip him of his power. We have none elſe to truſt, no creature can order any thing for the Churches good without Gods Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and direction. What ſhould we truſt him for? For that wherein his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is concerned, which is more worth to him than all the World beſides. Truſt him moſt when inſtruments fail. God takes them off ſometimes, to ſhew that he needs not any, and to have our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:136156:200"/>rightly placed on him, which ſtaggered before between him and the Creature.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>All the Godly formerly did act Faith on a leſs foundation.</hi> The Godly Patriarchs who lived eight or nine hundred years, depended upon providence that long time; and ſhall not we for ſeventy years, the uſual term of mans life! They had Promiſes to ſupport them, we have not only the ſame Promiſe but the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances of them too. They had Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences; we have the ſame and more, all upon Recordin Scripture, all ſince the Canon of Scripture was cloſed, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever God hath remarkably done for his people in all ages. <hi>Adam</hi> had but one promiſe, and but little experience of Gods Providence, yet no doubt truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in him. We have a multitude of Promiſes not only pronounced, but ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, confirmed by many repetitions, which are freſh obligations laid by God upon himſelf. The experience of all the Providences of God towards his Church for above five thouſand years; and ſhall our Faith ſtagger when upon us are come the ends of the World?
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:136156:200"/>doth it become us to have our Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Faith ſo ſtrong, and our Exerciſe of it ſo weak? The Promiſe of Chriſt<note n="*" place="margin">Iſa. 7 14.</note> that a Virgin ſhould bring forth a Son, was thought by God a ſufficient ſecurity to ſupport their confidence in him againſt the fury of their enemies; It being a greater wonder that a Virgin without loſs of her Virginity ſhould bring forth a Son, than the routing of an Hoſt of Enemies. Is not then the performance of this, Gods actual ſending his Son to us through the Womb of a Virgin, a higher ground of conſidence for the Churches ſucceſs in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing elſe, than barely the Promiſe could be? All creatures in danger have a natural confidence in God, <hi>He is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of all the ends of the Earth;</hi> but the Churches confidence may be mere firmly placed in him, becauſe he is particularly the God of their Salvation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65 5. <hi>By terrible things, in Righteouſneſs, wilt thou anſwer us, O God of our Salvation, who art the cenfidence of all the ends of the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>'Tis your only way to have mercy for the Church and for your ſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="334" facs="tcp:136156:201"/>
            <p>If he <hi>take pleaſure in them that hope in his mercy,</hi> as it is in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.11. He will take pleaſure to relieve them, He will <hi>ſtrengthen the bars of their gates, verſe</hi> 13. If he take pleaſure in them that hope in his mercy, then the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and more lively their hope is, the more intenſe is Gods pleaſure in them. If they do not hope in his Mercy, he hath no pleaſure in them, and no delight to them. He hath a goodneſs laid up for them that fear him, and he will lay it out too for them that truſt in him. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.15. <hi>O how great is thy good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which thou haſt laid up for them that fear thee, which thou hast wrought for them that truſt in thee before the ſons of men?</hi> 'Tis laid up for all that fear him, but it is wrought for them that truſt in him. It is manifeſted upon ſpecial acts of truſt and reliance, and wrought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſons of men. Thoſe that own God publickly in a way of reliance, God will own them publickly in a way of kindneſs. Faith is the key that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks the Cabinet of ſpecial Providence. Thoſe eyes which move about all the World, are fixed upon thoſe that truſt in

            </p>
            <p>The ſixth Duty, <hi>Wait upon God in the way of his Providence.</hi> Wait upon him as he is a faithful Creator<note n="*" place="margin">1 Pe 4.19.</note> ; much more ſince the title of being our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer is added to that of our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, which ſtrengthens his Relation to us. Not to wait, diſparageth his care, bounds his power, or reflects upon his Wiſdom: as if he had ſtript himſelf of his immenſe goodneſs, and forgot both his Promiſe and his People; as if he had cancelled the Covenant, and given up his whole intereſt to the Luſts of men. Wait in the ſaddeſt appearances. The Hour of Chriſts death was diſmal in the World, and darkneſs was upon the Earth; a miraculous Eclipſe of the Sun, taken notice of by the very Heathens; yet were we never nearer to happineſs than in that dreadful time when our Saviour was moſt dyed in his own Blood. The Sanguine Complection of the Evening<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sky is a preſage of a fair ſucceeding Morning; ſo, many times is the red Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of the Church.</p>
            <pb n="386" facs="tcp:136156:202"/>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Wait upon him obedientially.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Commit your ſouls to God, but <hi>in well doing</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">1 Pet. 4.19.</note>. Uſe no indirect means; a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the precept cannot conſiſt with Faith in either Promiſe or Providence. The obeying part is ours, the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part is Gods, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.17. <hi>Let not thine heart envy ſinners, but be thou in the fear of the Lord all the day long, for ſurely there is an end, and thine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation ſhall not be cut off.</hi> God will govern all the day, but we muſt fear him all the day. When fear on our part, attends Government on Gods part, there will be an end of our carnal fears, and a good iſſue of our hopes. The greateſt deliverances of his Church have been when his People has ſtood ſtill. <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.13. As that deliverance was a type of all future ones, and a ground of Faith, ſo the carriage God enjoyned was a rule to his people in all future ſtraights. 'Tis againſt the Laws of Gods Government for thoſe liſted in his Service to ſtir without order. The Law is our ſtanding Rule of Duty. Providence cannot be a ſtanding viſible Rule, becauſe of the variety and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:136156:202"/>croſneſs of it ſometimes to our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions. Do not preſume to lead God, but be led by him: 'Tis our ſafety to follow him, 'tis our ſin and danger to preſume to be his Directors. We may loſe our ſelves when we are our own blind guides, and fall into a ditch; but when we follow God, he hath wiſdom to foreſee the Precipices we may ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble into, and goodneſs to divert us from them. By interpoſing carnal devices, men may perhaps have their ends, but with little comfort, perhaps much bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs to themſelves. <hi>Jacob</hi> by his haſty uſing his own and his mothers ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful project for the Bleſſing, got it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but a croſs too, for he was a man of Sorrows all his days. By waiting in Gods way, we ſhall have our ends with more ſweetneſs, becauſe purely a fruit of Gods care and goodneſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Wait patiently.</hi> How often are our Spirits troubled about future events, and affraid of the evil which threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens us, as if we were in pain for God, and in doubt of his wiſe Conduct Think not Gods time too long. He waits as much for a fit opportunity to ſhew his
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:136156:203"/>Mercy as you can wait for the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 13.18. <hi>Therefore will the Lord wait that he may be gracious unto you; bleſſed are all they that wait for him.</hi> 'Tis a part of our bleſſedneſs to wait for God, ſince it is a part of Gods kindneſs to wait for a fit ſeaſon to be gracious to us. 'Tis not for us to preſcribe Rules to God, but follow the Rules he preſcribes to us. He hath freely made his Promiſe, let him be Maſter of his own time to make it good. He will ſhew as much Wiſdom in accompliſhing, as he did mercy in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring it. God can do things in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but it is his wiſdom to take time, that his people may have time to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe their truſt, their hope, and their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. He will take time in the ways of his providence as well as he did in the works of Creation. He allotted ſix days to that which he could have framed in a minute. He is Judge of what is needful for us, and when it is needful for us. If God ſhould give us that, which is a mercy in its own nature, many times when we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it, it might not be a mercy. If we will truſt the skill of his Wiſdom for the
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:136156:203"/>beſt ſeaſon, it cannot but be a mercy, for he will give it us with his onw glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and grace wrapt up in it, which will make it ſweeter to himſelf when his Wiſdom is honoured, and ſweeter to us when our good is promoted. Gods methods appear in the end both wiſer and better than our frames. Infinite goodneſs aims more at our welfare, than our ſhallow ſelf-love; and infinite wiſdom can conduct things to our wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare better than our ſhort-ſighted skill He that knows all the moments of time, knows beſt how to time his actions. As God ſtaid for a fulneſs of time to bring the great Redemption by Chriſt into the World; ſo he ſtays for a fulneſs of time to bring all the great conſequences and appendices of it unto his Church. <hi>Every thing is beautiful in his time.</hi> In its own time, in Gods time, not in ours<note n="*" place="margin">Eccleſ. 3.11.</note>.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Wait conſtantly.</hi> Though the Wheels of providence ſeem ſometimes to ſtand ſtill<note n="*" place="margin">Ezek. 1.21.</note>, and God ſeems to put a period to the care of his Church; yet let not us neglect our duty. Wait a while, and the Wheels will be put upon
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:136156:204"/>their former rolling. Some particular paſſages of Providence may trouble us for a while, but in the iſſue God may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer our deſires above our expectations, and thereby confute our fears. His Providences are ſometimes like Rivers that run under ground, out of ſight; but will riſe again with a delightful Stream, with ſome new Medicinal qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, contracted from the Earth by the way. <hi>Joſeph,</hi> a Priſoner, waits upon God for his Liberty, and God gives him freedom with preferment. God can bring about his Peoples ſafety by unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected ways. Who would have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined before, that his own Dream ſhould make him a Captive, and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs</hi> Dream make him a Favourite? The chief Butler remembers him not, till <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was in an exigency, and the divining skill of the Wiſe men of <hi>Egypt</hi> confounded. <hi>Joſeph</hi> loſt nothing by waiting upon God, who made ſo many circumſtances concur to promote his Honour. Wait therefore upon him in the ſoreſt afflictions. The Church is only afflicted in Mercy, but the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of it are pulled up by the roots,
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:136156:204"/>
               <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.11. <hi>I am with thee to ſave thee; though I make a full end of the Nations whither I have ſcattered thee, yet I will not make a full end of thee, but I will cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect thee in meaſure.</hi> God deals with his People as a Father, who corrects to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, not to deſtroy; but with his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies he deals as a Judge. God's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, like <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Rod, may ſeem ſometimes a devouring Serpent, but it is to convince the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and deliver the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Wait in the uſe of lawful means for preſervation.</hi> Not to uſe means, is to ſlight his Providence, not to truſt it. It ſeems not to conſiſt with the wiſdom of God to order things always ſo as to be neceſſitated to put forth an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary power in things which his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures by a common Providence can naturally accompliſh. God ſaves by natural means; when they will not ſerve the turn, he will ſave by ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural. God choſe an Ark to preſerve <hi>Noah</hi> in. He did not want ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral means for his preſervation. He might have catched him up in a Cloud, and continued him there till the drying up
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:136156:205"/>of the waters. <hi>Noah</hi> doth not diſpute the buſineſs with God, but prepares an Ark according to his order, and he was righteous in his obedience, as well as in his truſt. God would not preſerve our Saviour by a Miracle, when ordinary means would ſerve the turn. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands <hi>Joſeph</hi> by his Angel to flee into <hi>Egypt</hi> with the Child<note n="*" place="margin">Matt. 2.13.</note>. <hi>Joſeph</hi> deſires not God to preſerve him by an extraordinary pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to ſave his pains of travelling; he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits to Gods order, and God quickly clears the way for his return. Indeed ſometimes the wheels of Providence are lifted up from the Earth, and do not go in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary tracts<note n="*" place="margin">Ezek 1.19.</note> ; but Miracles muſt be left to Gods Pleaſure; for us to deſire them, is to tempt our great Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
            <p>The Seventh Duty. <hi>Pray for the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis an encouragement that our Suit in this caſe will not be denied. The deſire of the Churches welfare is conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his Counſel, which ſhall ſtand notwithſtanding the Devices of men.<note place="margin">Prov. 19.21.</note> His counſel in particular concerns of
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:136156:205"/>men ſhall ſtand, much more is the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of his counſel for the church. He is a God hearing Prayer in a way of common Providence, and a God hearing Prayer in a way of ſpecial at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 61.1. <hi>Hear my cry, O God, attend unto my Prayer. David</hi> deſires that God would hear him, as more particularly concerned in his caſe. He is ſo in the concerns of his Church. Will he hear an <hi>Iſhmael</hi> crying for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and young Lyons roaring for their Prey; and ſtop his Ears to the voice of his own Spirit in his People, plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Church, dearer to him than the whole maſs of Nature? We have greater Arguments to uſe, than in any other caſe. The Relation the Church hath to God; The affection God hath to the Church. <hi>Lazarus whom thou lovest is ſick,</hi> was <hi>Martha</hi>'s argument to Chriſt. What greater encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to our Petitions, than Gods affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, than Gods Relation? God loves to have our affection comply with his. God loves others the better for ſoliciting its welfare. <hi>Moſes</hi> had the greateſt manifeſtation of Gods Love after he
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:136156:206"/>he had prayed for the <hi>Iſraelites</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Exod. 32.32.</note>, though in a caſe of ſin; and preſently after in <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.11. God ſpeaks with him <hi>face to face, as a man ſpeaks to his friend;</hi> and in the ſame chapter, and the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. God ſhews him <hi>his glory</hi> as much as he was capable to bear. <hi>Daniel</hi> was a great Petitioner for the Church<note n="*" place="margin">Dan 9.3, 21. Dan. 10.2, 5.</note>. He was Gods great favourite upon that account, and had the cleareſt and higheſt Revelations made to him of the courſe of Providence in the World.</p>
            <p>The eighth Duty. <hi>When you receive any mercy for the church in anſwer of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, give God the glory of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The variety of his Providences gives us matter for new ſongs and compoſitions.<note place="margin">Pſal. 149.1</note> What Volleys of joyful ſhouts! What Hallelujahs to God do we find upon the Ruin of Antichriſt! <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.1, 2, 3. God calls for Praiſe out of the Throne, <hi>v.</hi> 5. and the Church returns it, <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7. 'Tis God rides upon the Cherub, 'tis God that ſits upon the wings of the Wind,<note place="margin">Pſal. 18 10</note> 'tis God who is in all Inſtruments to quicken their motions, and direct them to their ſcope.</p>
            <pb n="395" facs="tcp:136156:206"/>
            <p>The Ninth Duty. <hi>Imitate God in his affection to the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Chriſt did what he did for the good of his Church: God doth what he doth for the advantage of the Church. Let the ſame mind be in us that was in Chriſt; let the ſame end be ours which is the end of God. Thus we ſhall be like our Creator, thus we ſhall be like our Governour, thus we ſhall be like our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer. Men take it kindly from others that love thoſe they have a reſpect for. God loves all that love his people, and bleſſes them that bleſs them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.3. <hi>I will bleſs them that bleſs thee, and curſe them that curſe thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Tenth Duty. <hi>Look after ſincerity before God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis for the ſecurity of ſuch that God ſhews himſelf ſtrong. No man that fully believes and underſtands this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, but ſhould be glad to be of that happy Society, that Aſſembly of the firſt-born, who are under the care of a watchful eye, and the mighty power of the God of the whole Earth. When God choſe <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the very ſtrangers ſhould for their own Intereſt joyn with
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:136156:207"/>them<note n="*" place="margin">Iſa. 14.1</note>. And to ſuch as <hi>take hold of his Covenant</hi> he Promiſes to <hi>give a name in his houſe that ſhall not be cut off</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Iſa. 56.4, 5.</note>. Yea, even <hi>to the Sons of the Strangers that ſhould joyn themſelves to the Lord. v.</hi> 6. Let this encourage us to Chriſtianity. God never encouraged men to be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians by promiſes of Worldly great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but by Promiſes of a conſtant care of them for their happineſs, by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of making all things work toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for their good. If God will ſhew himſelf ſtrong for thoſe that are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in heart towards him, then he hath no ſtrength for thoſe that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound and falſe in heart towards him. No man hath an intereſt in his ſpecial Providence without Faith. The Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Knowledg, Wiſdom, of God, are all ſet againſt him. Though the whole World be in commotions, the earth be removed, and the Mountains caſt into the depths of the Sea, there is no ground of fear to Faith; but what Buckler againſt them hath Unbelief and Hypocriſie? What ſecurity againſt Wrath can Riches give you? What de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt his power can your Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſherd
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:136156:207"/>ſtrength afford you? It was not for <hi>Jobs</hi> wealth that God made his boaſts of him, but for his ſincerity, <hi>Job</hi> 1.8. <hi>Hast thou conſidered my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant</hi> Job, <hi>that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man?</hi> And for the want of this, he loaths a World. Labour therefore for ſincerity towards God; beg it of God. Get the evidence of it, and preſerve it.</p>
